### **Learning Technologies**
#### **Vision**
Every BLS learner – a future-ready t(h)inker who makes a difference.

#### **Mission**
To create learning experiences and environments where all students can  connect, curate and create.

#### **New Media Literacies**
As a Learning Technologies department, we champion the teaching and learning of new media literacies and create opportunities within the curriculum for students to connect, curate and create. These new media literacies are essential for students to become future-ready individuals who are comfortable with the use of technology while discerning their consumption of information. Through this integration of new media literacies in our curriculum, students are provided authentic contexts and scenarios for them to utilise ICT related skills for a meaningful purpose.

#### **Real World Application**
Our department believes in making learning relevant to students. As part of their alternative assessments, students engage themselves in both group  and individual project tasks that enables them to apply their skills in an authentic learning setting. For Elements of Business Skills, students have the opportunity to embark on learning journeys that enable them to understand how business operates.

#### **Competitions**
To enable our students to understand their own interests and potential, our department creates opportunities for our students to hone their talents. Yearly, our students are expose to national competitions such as the Animation and Game Making Competition that enable them to build their skills and work towards achieving their dreams and aspirations.
