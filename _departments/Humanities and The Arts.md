### **Humanities and The Arts**
#### **Vision**
Every BLS student, a World Changer who Wonders and Wanders.

#### **Mission**
The world is our classroom. Our mission is to craft engaging learning experiences that equip students with skills that enable them to navigate a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

#### **Humanities Investigation Programme**
In our classroom, our students are explorers and investigators. Through the various inquiry based and experiential learning activities, our students discover first-hand the world around them and learn the relevance of Humanities in their everyday life. Harnessing technology in our lessons, our students are also exposed to multiple perspectives and are guided to examine societal issues with a keen eye.

#### **Geographical Investigation**
Learning Geography is an adventure at Boon Lay. Taking every fieldtrip as a quest, our students navigate the field, collect data and conduct interviews to test their hypothesis. Through the Geographical Investigation programme, students get the chance to visit fieldwork sites such as Botanic Gardens, Sentosa and Chinatown.

#### **Historical Investigation**
History comes alive in our classrooms with visits to the National Museum of Singapore and re-enactments of key historical events. Students are exposed to various interesting artefacts to enhance their knowledge about the history of Singapore.

#### **Art & Music Programme**
The passionate pursuit of Art & Music takes place in our Art and Music rooms where students have the opportunity to try their hand at various mediums and genres. In Art, students work with professional artists and teachers to explore traditional and digital mediums. In Music, students will have the opportunity to learn and create melodic tunes with instruments and digital devices.

BLS Human Library is a platform where Boonlayians have the opportunity to borrow human “books” who come from all walks of life. Hearing our invited guests’ personal stories, our students have deep conversations, challenge stereotypes and learn more about civil society.
