### **Craft & Technology**
#### **Vision**
Every student – a creative and critical thinker who possesses empathetic qualities.

#### **Mission**
We design learning experiences and adopt assessment practices that equip students with knowledge, skills and learning dispositions that provides the foundation for lifelong learning. With the provision of a variety of education technologies, students experience authentic learning through the investigation, reflection and creation of their end-products.

The Craft and Technology curriculum consists of a series of projects that students undertake to develop empathy and sensitivity to people’s needs progressively. Through these projects, students increase their appreciation for Culinary Creation and Design. At the lower secondary level, students are encouraged to analyse, communicate, collaborate, reason and problem solve in teams. The department adopts e-Pedagogies and carries them out through Team Based Learning. The interactive nature of Team Based Learning encourages pupils to develop communication, collaboration and critical thinking skills. Through Team Based Learning, students become more confident to take on individual project work when at the Upper Secondary Level.
