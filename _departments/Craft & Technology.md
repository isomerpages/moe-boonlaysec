As part of the Craft and Technology curriculum, students experience authentic learning through project work. Students learn to build empathy through the user centric products that they design. In teams, students are encouraged to analyse, communicate, collaborate, reason and problem solve. Students are also assessed via various modes such as design journal work, report writing and practical work.
