#### Vision

Every student â€“ a creative and critical thinker who possesses empathetic qualities.

#### Mission

To design engaging learning experiences that equip all students with knowledge, skills and learning dispositions that provides the foundation for lifelong learning. With the provision of education technologies, our students experience authentic learning through the investigation, reflection and creation of products. 

Implementation of Design Thinking in D&T

Using a learner-centred approach, lower secondary students are actively involved in the entire design process, given the choices to explore various design possibilities and freedom to express their creativity. Students get to test their ideas and mock up iteratively, learning from failures and making improvements, promoting a growth mindset and resilience while developing design skills.

As part of the Craft and Technology curriculum, students experience authentic learning through project work. Students learn to build empathy through the user centric products that they design. In teams, students are encouraged to analyse, communicate, collaborate, reason and problem solve. Students are also assessed via various modes such as design journal work, report writing and practical work.
