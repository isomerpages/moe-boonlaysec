### **Mathematics**
#### **Vision**
The Mathematics Department as a key element in BLS’ curriculum in anchoring our students’ growth.

#### **Mission**
Develop in students a spirit of persistence and an agile mind through the course of BLS’s Mathematics Curriculum to take on the challenges of tomorrow.

#### **Classroom Experiences**
Learning takes place in the classroom and beyond it. In the preparation of lesson materials, our teachers catered to students’ diverse profile through designing resources based on the Differentiated Instruction (DI) approach. Within the classroom, our teachers facilitate learning by getting students to understand the problems through inquiry and discussion. Our assessment tasks include solving real-world context problems where learners get to develop 21st century competencies such as critical and creative thinking skills. Through the use of Assessment for learning (AfL) strategies in the Mathematics classroom, the learners get to track their own progress and make their adjustments accordingly. There is also extensive use of technology for effective teaching and learning within the classroom and encouraged continued learning outside the classroom.

#### **Mathematics Learning Journeys**
The Mathematics learning journeys conducted are learning opportunities in which students are able to integrate their learning in the classroom and apply to real life contexts. Through complementing the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, the learning journeys hope to help students develop an appreciation and enjoyment of Mathematics in everyday situations.
