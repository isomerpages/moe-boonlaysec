#### **Vision**
Reflective and contributing individuals who are well-equipped with knowledge and skills for a world where change is the only constant

#### **Mission**
Science is a body of knowledge that represents understanding of natural systems and the processes. However, even the most well-established theories have limitations and are being continually extended and refined. In this continuously-evolving world, our students need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills set to enable to refine their understanding with time. 

The Science Department aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the constantly changing world around them through an inquiry-based approach in teaching and learning of Science. Students will experience learning characterised by exploration and risk-taking, by curiosity and motivation, by engagement in reflective and creative thinking, and by connection with real-life situations.

#### **Scientific inquiry**
A systematic approach where students learn a comprehensive inquiry process and have the opportunity to engage in inquiry. Key processes:

*   See-Think- Wonder and Claim-Support-Question Thinking Routines
*   experiments
*   investigative projects and assignments using an inquiry model to internalise a process for inquiry that is transferable to everyday life situations

#### **Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT)**
Metacognition processing by students- thinking about thinking, learning to learn, anchored on 21CC Standards and Benchmarks:

*   Generate novel ideas
*   Exercise sound reasoning and reflective thinking to make good decisions
*   Manage complexities and ambiguities well

Development of CIT will be facilitated through project work, field trips, green and other enrichment activities with explicit thinking skills, problem solving skills and rubrics.


#### **Mastery learning**
Students master the prerequisite level in order to move on to the next level of learning

If a student does not achieve mastery on the level, they are given additional support and scaffold in learning. The cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and moves on to the next stage.

#### **Home-Based Learning (HBL)**
A platform that provides opportunities for students to engage in self-directed learning and develops students’ tenacity to solve problems they may face in the learning process. Science lesson packages are prepared by teachers and uploaded online at the [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login) for the students to access from home. Students will be guided so that they can learn from the SLS portal, textbook, school-prepared resources, and learn through simple home experiments, collaborative projects using personal learning device. There will be opportunities for the students to video conference with their subject teachers to seek clarifications in learning.
