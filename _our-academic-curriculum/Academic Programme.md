### **Academic Programme**
Our academic programme seeks to equip students with the essential skill sets, knowledge, and attitudes that would allow them to thrive in their next stage of higher education. Not only do we seek to prepare them well to excel academically, we also make 21st century competencies one of our priorities. For example, in the learning of Mathematics, students learn to use mathematics concepts to create solutions to real-world problems. Likewise, in the learning of English Language, they will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively in different settings. In every subject, students will be given opportunities to develop relevant and critical skills so that they are future-ready and prepared to take on any challenge they may face in the future.

To pave the way ahead for students to innovate, the school has created special learning studios for some subjects to set up a stimulating and engaging environment for learning. Technology is also a main tool which our teachers use to provide students ways to initiate and own their learning through easy access to knowledge and resources. Beyond learning within the classrooms, students are brought on learning journeys and trails, and outdoor investigations where they are encouraged to inquire and learn in real-world contexts.
