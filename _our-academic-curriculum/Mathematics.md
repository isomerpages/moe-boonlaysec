<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Mathematics Department as a key element in BLS’ curriculum in anchoring
our students’ growth.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Develop in students a spirit of persistence and an agile mind through
the course of BLS’s Mathematics Curriculum to take on the challenges of
tomorrow.</p>
<h4><strong>Classroom Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Learning takes place in the classroom and beyond it. In the preparation
of lesson materials, our teachers catered to students’ diverse profile
through designing resources based on the Differentiated Instruction (DI)
approach. Within the classroom, our teachers facilitate learning by getting
students to understand the problems through inquiry and discussion. Our
assessment tasks include solving real-world context problems where learners
get to develop 21st century competencies such as critical and creative
thinking skills. Through the use of Assessment for learning (AfL) strategies
in the Mathematics classroom, the learners get to track their own progress
and make their adjustments accordingly. There is also extensive use of
technology for effective teaching and learning within the classroom and
encouraged continued learning outside the classroom.</p>

<h4><strong>Mathematics comes alive @Mathematics Carnival!</strong></h4>
<p>To visualise how Mathematics is present in everyday life, students apply
what they have learnt in classrooms to design carnival games as part of
their Alternative Assessment. Students made use of mathematical concepts
to vary the difficulty levels in their games that they have created, and
the student participants try to outwit the game designers to win. In designing
the games, the students have shown a high level of creativity and imagination,
as well as developed their communication skills to explain the rules and
regulations of their games. To make the whole experience as authentic as
possible, the school set aside one afternoon for all the S1-S3 NT students
to showcase their games at the Mathematics Carnival and invited the rest
of the school cohort as well as all staff members to participate and join
in the fun.</p>
