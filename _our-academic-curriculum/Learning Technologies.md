<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every BLS learner â€“ a future-ready t(h)inker who makes a difference.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To create learning experiences and environments where all students can&nbsp;
connect, curate and create.</p>
<h4><strong>New Media Literacies</strong></h4>
<p>As a Learning Technologies department, we champion the teaching and learning
of new media literacies and create opportunities within the curriculum
for students to connect, curate and create. These new media literacies
are essential for students to become future-ready individuals who are comfortable
with the use of technology while discerning their consumption of information.
Through this integration of new media literacies in our curriculum, students
are provided authentic contexts and scenarios for them to utilise ICT related
skills for a meaningful purpose.</p>

<h4><strong>Real World Application</strong></h4>
<p>Our department believes in making learning relevant to students. As part
of their alternative assessments, students engage themselves in both group&nbsp;
and individual project tasks that enables them to apply their skills in
an authentic learning setting. For Elements of Business Skills, students
have the opportunity to embark on learning journeys that enable them to
understand how business operates.</p>
<h4><strong>Competitions</strong></h4>
<p>To enable our students to understand their own interests and potential,
our department creates opportunities for our students to hone their talents.
Yearly, our students are expose to national competitions such as the Animation
and Game Making Competition that enable them to build their skills and
work towards achieving their dreams and aspirations.</p>
