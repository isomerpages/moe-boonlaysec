<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every BLS learner – a future-ready t(h)inker who makes a difference.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, engaging, and hands-on learning
environment where students master the foundational Computing, Elements
of Business (EBS) and Principles of Accounts (POA). Through a blend of
theoretical knowledge and real-world applications, we aim to cultivate
problem-solving skills, digital literacy, and entrepreneurial mindsets
that equip students to navigate the VUCA world.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Focus Areas</strong></h4>
<p><u>Holistic Education</u>: We balance foundational academic knowledge
with 21st-century skills in digital literacy, communication, critical thinking,
and collaboration. To enable our students to pursue their interests and
talents, our department creates opportunities for our students to participate
in national competitions such as the Animation and Game Making Competition
and the National Swift Explorers’ Challenge.</p>
<p>We’re pleased to share that one of our students obtained the Platinum
award in the 2025 edition of the annual Nationwide Animation and Game Making
competition!</p>
