#### **Vision**
The Mother Tongue Languages Department aims to empower all Boonlayians to flourish in the future by placing the 21st-Century Competencies at the core of student learning.

#### **Mission**
We see Mother Tongue language as a living language – one that is used on a day-to-day basis, hence students are provided with real-life experiences to develop their thinking and communication skills grounded in sound character. Leveraging the usage of innovative pedagogies and tools, we are committed to nurture our students to become active, confident learners and proficient users of their Mother Tongue languages.

#### **Active, Student-Centred Learning**
We aim to provide our students with unique learning experiences and various ways to apply their learning.

#### **Interdisciplinary Learning - Mother Tongue &amp; Social Studies Collaboration**

In&nbsp; 2023, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department collaborated with the Social Studies (SS) Unit to come up with a multi-disciplinary, inquiry-based project as a form of Alternative Assessment. In this project, students are given the opportunity to explore the inclusivity in Singapore through a learning journey, learn about Singapore’s inclusive society, and the government’s effort to instill inclusivity among citizens. The learning experience culminates in a digital artefact which the students showcased during their MTL lessons, on top of completing an Issues Investigation task for SS.

#### **Catering to Students’ Strengths and Needs**
As a department, we have carried out Secondary 1 Bridging lessons to ensure a seamless transition for the students from P6 to Secondary One to close their learning gaps. This allows students to build a stronger foundation in the subject, and nurture their strengths, so they are more engaged in learning.

#### **Appreciating our Cultural Heritage**

 
##### **Mother Tongue Fortnight**

We aim to provide a balanced MT Fortnight programme that develops students’ interest in learning the language and cultures. Students are exposed to a wide range of activities during the MT Fortnight annually.

Held over Week 6 and 7 in Term 4 this year, some of the programmes and activities lined up for our students include exposure to Chinese visual arts and traditional games, Malay Language folktales and traditional music as well as learning different forms of Indian traditional art.


##### **Mother Tongue Fiesta**

In order to promote inter-school collaboration in the learning of MTL languages and make MTL an interesting language to learn for students, we organise MTL and Cultural Fiesta on a yearly basis, providing a platform for students and teachers of the W3 cluster schools to come together and participate in engaging and meaningful inter-school language and cultural competitions. This motivates students in the cluster to strive towards excellence in their MTL language proficiency and acquire depth in cultural learning. In recent years, we have extended our invitation to the W3 cluster primary schools for the essay writing competition to develop an interest in writing by our younger students.

#### **Developing Real-World Skills through Authentic Learning Experiences**

In the BLS MTL department, we strive to make learning experiences more authentic, so that the learning process becomes more relevant and engaging to the learner, increasing their preparation for the real world.

##### **Chinese Language Department: “Unsung Heroes” Project Work**

Aligned with the “Unsung Heroes” theme featured in our curriculum, Secondary One students are granted a unique chance to uncover the untold narratives of those who have significantly contributed to our school community. These unsung heroes include canteen stall vendors, teachers, security guards, IT personnel, and many more. In a collaborative effort, students form teams to identify these unsung heroes within our school, conduct interviews, and craft special reports that shed light on these remarkable individuals, thus enabling us to gain insight into their extraordinary stories. This authentic learning experience fostered empathy among students, enabling them to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the individuals in their immediate surroundings and the things we often take for granted.


##### **Tamil Language Department: Banana Leaf Meal Activity**
We believe that small opportunities are the beginning of great achievements. In the BLS MTL department, we actively seek out contests and competitions held to give our students a platform to widen their horizons, test their limits, and realise their potential.

The TL department curated a delightful banana leaf meal experience for students to learn about the unique traditional dining practice. It was aimed to introduce students to the rich tapestry of tastes in Indian culture, delve deep into the concept and vocabulary of the six essential tastes (அறுசுவை உணவு) and explore the nuances of விருந்தோம்பல் (hospitality) on a profound level, providing a comprehensive and in-depth understanding. The activity was informative and also hands-on, offering students an experiential journey through these tastes as they indulge in the authentic flavours served during the banana leaf meal.

##### **Malay Language Department: Ketupat Weaving Event**
In the spirit of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, our school collaborated with the Malay Focus Group (MFG) from community partner, Jurong Spring Community Centre. The objective of this activity is to pass down the art of weaving ketupat, a traditional dish ubiquitous during Hari Raya, to the younger generation and in the spirit of ‘gotong-royong’ or togetherness, come together to weave as many ketupat cases to be filled and contributed to beneficiaries from the community. Volunteers from MFG rendered their service and expertise to teach our Sec 3 students the art of weaving ketupat over two sessions after which a group of students represented Boon Lay Secondary to join the Massive Ketupat Weaving Event in Jurong Spring CC. It was indeed an authentic learning experience for our students, to be able to uphold the Malay culture whilst giving back to the community.

##### **Learning and Growing through Participating in Competitions &amp; Events**

We believe that small opportunities are the beginning of great achievements. In the BLS MTL department, we actively seek out events,&nbsp; contests, and competitions held to give our students a platform to widen their horizons, test their limits, and realise their potential.
