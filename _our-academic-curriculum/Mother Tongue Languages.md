<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department aims to empower all Boonlayians
to flourish in the future by placing the emerging 21st-Century Competencies
at the core of student learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>We see Mother Tongue language as a living language – one that is used
on a day-to-day basis, hence students are provided with real-life experiences
to develop their thinking and communication skills grounded in sound character.
Leveraging the usage of innovative pedagogies and tools, we are committed
to nurture our students to become active, confident learners and proficient
users of their Mother Tongue languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Active, Student-Centred Learning</strong></h3>
<p>We aim to provide our students with unique learning experiences and various
ways to apply their learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Inquiry Based Learning Alternative Assessments</strong></h4>
<p>The MTL Department adopts an Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) approach in
the design of our Alternative Assessments, providing students with a structured
thinking process that encourages curiosity, critical inquiry, and deeper
learning. Through IBL, students collaborate in groups, communicate their
ideas effectively, and present their findings with clarity and confidence.</p>
<p>To strengthen real-world application of the Mother Tongue Languages, students
engage in discussions and research on trending topics or current affairs.
They collect authentic data—such as through interviews, surveys, or observations—which
allows them to apply the language meaningfully in real contexts. These
experiences help students see the relevance of MTL beyond the classroom
and develop essential communication skills.</p>
<p>The Alternative Assessment forms one of the Weighted Assessments for Secondary
1 to Secondary 3, offering a dynamic and authentic platform for students
to demonstrate their language proficiency, collaborative skills, and ability
to engage with real-world issues using their Mother Tongue Languages.</p>
<h3><br><strong>Catering to Students’ Strengths and Needs</strong></h3>
<p>As a department, we have carried out Secondary 1 Bridging lessons to ensure
a seamless transition for the students from P6 to Secondary One to close
their learning gaps. This allows students to build a stronger foundation
in the subject, and nurture their strengths, so they are more engaged in
learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Appreciating our Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong></h4>

<p>We aim to provide a balanced MT Fortnight programme that develops students’
interest in learning the language and cultures. Students are exposed to
a wide range of activities during the MT Fortnight annually.</p>
<p>Some of the programmes and activities lined up for our students include
exposure to Chinese visual arts and traditional games, Malay Language folktales
and traditional music as well as learning different forms of Indian traditional
art.</p>
<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Languages and Cultural Fiesta</strong></h4>

<p>To promote inter-school collaboration in the learning of Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) and to make MTL engaging and meaningful, the MTL Department
has been organising the annual MTL and Cultural Fiesta for W3 cluster schools
since 2008. This long-standing event provides a vibrant platform for students
and teachers to connect, fostering the e-21CC competency of Communication,
Collaboration and Information Skills (CCI) while deepening appreciation
for language and culture.</p>
<p>This year’s Fiesta featured cultural booths with traditional games and
interactive audience quizzes, boosting student engagement and strengthening
cultural awareness. Creative writing competitions and quizzes on culture
and language further injected joy of learning and motivated students to
excel in both linguistic proficiency and cultural understanding.</p>
<p>Through these authentic, collaborative and culturally rich experiences,
the MTL and Cultural Fiesta inspires students to appreciate their heritage
while developing confidence and enthusiasm in using their Mother Tongue
Languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Developing Real-World Skills through Authentic Learning Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>In the BLS MTL department, we strive to make learning experiences more
authentic, so that the learning process becomes more relevant and engaging
to the learner, increasing their preparation for the real world.</p>
<h4><strong>Chinese Language Department</strong></h4>

<p>The Chinese Language (CL) Reading and Creative Writing Programme aims
to nurture students’ love for language while developing 21st Century Competencies
such as communication, collaboration, and critical and creative thinking.</p>
<p>Through the&nbsp; Reading Programme, students read digital novels via
the SLS platform and participate in guided discussions to explore characterisation,
themes, and literary techniques. These sessions encourage perspective-taking
and empathy as students connect textual experiences to real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Authentic engagement continues beyond the classroom, as local authors
are invited to share their creative journeys, offering students insight
into how ideas and emotions are shaped into literary works.</p>
<p>Students are further empowered to express their own voices through the
Creative Writing Programme, producing micro-novels, prose, and poetry.
With guidance from teachers, a student editorial team curates and publishes
selected works in an anthology—providing hands-on experience in writing,
editing, and publishing.</p>
<p>By blending reading, creativity, and authentic application, the programme
helps students become confident, expressive, and socially aware communicators
in a globalised world.</p>
<h4><strong>Tamil Language Department: AI- infused<s> </s>&nbsp;Teaching &amp; Learning</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MTL5.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students built their understanding of how AI can be applied in the use
of Tamil Language through a structured reading and creative storytelling
programme. They began by engaging with a series of Tamil short stories
by reading, analysing, and discussing their themes and language use. Building
on this foundation, students then applied their knowledge to either craft
an original story inspired by their imagination or re-tell a familiar one
using AI tools to produce digital narratives.</p>
<p>Their learning experience culminated in their participation in the AI
Storytelling Competition at NUS, organised by the Alagappa Institute, which
offered Tamil Language students an exciting platform to explore AI and
digital creativity. During the workshop, students honed their skills in
using AI-driven applications such as CapCut for photo and video editing,
ElevenLabs for generating realistic voiceovers, and Pixabay for curating
suitable background music.</p>
<p>Through brainstorming and collaborative planning, participants transformed
their ideas into engaging digital stories. This hands-on experience deepened
their proficiency in Tamil language and translation, while nurturing teamwork,
creativity, and resilience. In the process, students also strengthened
key e21CC competencies—including critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking,
as well as communication, collaboration, and information skills.</p>
<p>Overall, the experience empowered students to merge technology with storytelling,
inspiring them to express their ideas confidently and creatively through
innovative digital platforms.</p>
<h4><strong>Malay Language Department: Gamification of ML Reading Programme</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MTL6.png">
</div>
<p>The Malay Language (ML) Reading Programme is designed to strengthen reading
skills and engagement for all learners, including students with Special
Educational Needs (SEN). Curated by the ML Reading Programme Team in collaboration
with our school counsellors, the programme ensures that learning experiences
are responsive to diverse student needs.</p>
<p>Technology and gamification are key features of the programme. Customizable
e-books with “Read to Me” functions support dyslexic learners, while text-to-speech
tools and AI-generated visuals enhance fluency, comprehension, and story
understanding. Speech evaluation tools offer stress-free oral practice,
and interactive post-reading activities—such as vocabulary games and crosswords—reinforce
learning in enjoyable ways.</p>
<p>A highlight of the programme is The Story Race, an outdoor gamified adventure
where students solve story-based puzzles, role-play characters, and complete
collaborative tasks. As part of the race, students also interact with the
school’s administrative staff, providing real-world opportunities to apply
communication skills in an authentic and purposeful context.</p>
<p>With adaptive tools and thoughtfully designed activities, the programme
promotes accessibility, confidence, and active participation for SEN students
while fostering a love for reading among all learners.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning and Growing through Participating in Competitions &amp; Events</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that small opportunities are the beginning of great achievements.
In the BLS MTL department, we actively seek out events,&nbsp;contests,
and competitions held to give our students a platform to widen their horizons,
test their limits, and realise their potential.</p>
