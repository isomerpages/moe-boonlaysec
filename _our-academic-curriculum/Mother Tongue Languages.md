<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department aims to empower all Boonlayians
to flourish in the future by placing the emerging 21st-Century Competencies
at the core of student learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>We see Mother Tongue language as a living language – one that is used
on a day-to-day basis, hence students are provided with real-life experiences
to develop their thinking and communication skills grounded in sound character.
Leveraging the usage of innovative pedagogies and tools, we are committed
to nurture our students to become active, confident learners and proficient
users of their Mother Tongue languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Active, Student-Centred Learning</strong></h3>
<p>We aim to provide our students with unique learning experiences and various
ways to apply their learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Interdisciplinary Learning - Mother Tongue &amp; Social Studies Collaboration</strong></h4>
<p>Since 2022, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department has collaborated
with the Social Studies (SS) Unit to come up with a multi-disciplinary,
inquiry-based project as a form of Alternative Assessment. In this project,
students are given the opportunity to explore the inclusivity in Singapore
through a learning journey, learn about Singapore’s inclusive society,
and the government’s effort to instill inclusivity among citizens. The
learning experience culminates in a digital artefact which the students
showcased during their MTL lessons, on top of completing an Issue Investigation
task for SS.</p>
<h3><strong>Catering to Students’ Strengths and Needs</strong></h3>
<p>As a department, we have carried out Secondary 1 Bridging lessons to ensure
a seamless transition for the students from P6 to Secondary One to close
their learning gaps. This allows students to build a stronger foundation
in the subject, and nurture their strengths, so they are more engaged in
learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Appreciating our Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong></h4>

<p>We aim to provide a balanced MT Fortnight programme that develops students’
interest in learning the language and cultures. Students are exposed to
a wide range of activities during the MT Fortnight annually.</p>
<p>Some of the programmes and activities lined up for our students include
exposure to Chinese visual arts and traditional games, Malay Language folktales
and traditional music as well as learning different forms of Indian traditional
art.</p>
<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Languages and Cultural Fiesta</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>In order to promote inter-school collaboration in the learning of MTL
and make MTL an interesting language to learn for students, we organise
MTL and Cultural Fiesta on a yearly basis, providing a platform for students
and teachers of the W3 cluster schools to come together and participate
in engaging and meaningful inter-school language and cultural competitions.
This motivates students in the cluster to strive towards excellence in
their MTL language proficiency and acquire depth in cultural learning.
In recent years, we have extended our invitation to the W3 cluster primary
schools for the essay writing competition to develop an interest in writing
by our younger students.</p>

<h3><strong>Developing Real-World Skills through Authentic Learning Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>In the BLS MTL department, we strive to make learning experiences more
authentic, so that the learning process becomes more relevant and engaging
to the learner, increasing their preparation for the real world.</p>
<h4><strong>Chinese Language Department: “Unsung Heroes” Project Work</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>Aligned with the “Unsung Heroes” theme featured in our curriculum, Secondary
One students are granted a unique chance to uncover the untold narratives
of those who have significantly contributed to our school community. These
unsung heroes include canteen stall vendors, teachers, security guards,
IT personnel, and many more. In a collaborative effort, students form teams
to identify these unsung heroes within our school, conduct interviews,
and craft special reports that shed light on these remarkable individuals,
thus enabling us to gain insight into their extraordinary stories. This
authentic learning experience fostered empathy among students, enabling
them to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the individuals
in their immediate surroundings and the things we often take for granted.</p>
<h4><strong>Tamil Language Department: Banana Leaf Meal Activity</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>The TL department curated a delightful banana leaf meal experience for
students to learn about the unique traditional dining practice. It was
aimed to introduce students to the rich tapestry of tastes in Indian culture,
delve deep into the concept and vocabulary of the six essential tastes
(அறுசுவை உணவு) and explore the nuances of விருந்தோம்பல் (hospitality) on
a profound level, providing a comprehensive and in-depth understanding.
The activity was informative and also hands-on, offering students an experiential
journey through these tastes as they indulge in the authentic flavours
served during the banana leaf meal.</p>
<h4><strong>Malay Language Department: Gamification of ML Reading Programme</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>The Malay Language Reading Programme is designed to enhance reading skills
and engagement for all learners, including SEN students. It integrates
technology and gamification for an inclusive and immersive learning experience.
Key strategies include customizable e-books with "Read to Me" functions
to support dyslexic learners, text-to-speech tools for improving fluency
and comprehension, and AI-generated visuals to help students visualize
and connect with the story. Speech evaluation tools enable stress-free
oral practice with automated feedback, while interactive post-reading activities
such as vocabulary games and crosswords reinforce understanding in a fun,
creative way. The programme’s highlight is "The Story Race," a gamified
outdoor adventure where students solve plot-based puzzles, role-play characters,
and complete collaborative tasks at checkpoints in a race format. This
immersive activity blends physical movement, teamwork, and narrative exploration,
creating a dynamic and engaging experience. Designed with inclusivity in
mind, the programme ensures accessibility through adaptive tools and activities
that balance competition and collaboration, promoting confidence and participation
for SEN students. By combining innovative strategies and gamification,
the programme fosters a love for reading, builds comprehension, and creates
a collaborative learning environment tailored to diverse needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning and Growing through Participating in Competitions &amp; Events</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that small opportunities are the beginning of great achievements.
In the BLS MTL department, we actively seek out events,&nbsp;contests,
and competitions held to give our students a platform to widen their horizons,
test their limits, and realise their potential.</p>
