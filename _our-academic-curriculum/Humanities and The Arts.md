<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every BLS student, a World Changer who Wonders and Wanders.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The world is our classroom. Our mission is to craft engaging learning
experiences that equip students with skills that enable them to navigate
a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.</p>

<h4><strong>Making Learning Humanities an Authentic Experience&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In our classroom, our students are explorers and investigators. Through
the various inquiry based and experiential learning activities, our students
discover first-hand the world around them and learn the relevance of Humanities
in their everyday life. Harnessing technology in our lessons, our students
are also exposed to multiple perspectives and are guided to examine societal
issues with a keen eye.</p>
<h4><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong></h4>
<p>Learning Geography is an adventure at Boon Lay. Taking every fieldtrip
as a quest, our students navigate the field, collect data and conduct interviews
to test their hypothesis. Through the Geographical Investigation programme,
students get the chance to visit fieldwork sites such as Botanic Gardens,
Sentosa and Chinatown. Students also have the opportunity to present their
findings to experts.</p>

<h4><strong>Historical Investigation</strong></h4>
<p>History comes alive in our classrooms with visits to the National Museum
of Singapore and re-enactments of key historical events. Students are exposed
to various interesting artefacts to enhance their knowledge about the history
of Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>Art &amp; Music Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The passionate pursuit of Art &amp; Music takes place in our Art and Music
rooms where students have the opportunity to try their hand at various
mediums and genres. In Art, students work with professional artists and
teachers to explore traditional and digital mediums. In Music, students
will have the opportunity to learn and create melodic tunes with instruments
and digital devices.</p>

<h4><strong>Humanities &amp; the Arts Hearts Programme</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>BLS Human Library</strong></h5>
<p>BLS Human Library is a platform where Boonlayians have the opportunity
to borrow human “books” who come from all walks of life. Hearing our invited
guests’ personal stories, our students have deep conversations, challenge
stereotypes and learn more about civil society.</p>

<h4><strong>CURATE!</strong></h4>
<p>The Art Unit organises the Artist-In-School Scheme (AISS), programme which
aims at deepening students’ understanding and appreciation of art forms
annually. Every year, Upper Secondary Art students had the privilege to
learn from a diverse range of artists to build their foundation, techniques
and explore different mediums. Students also work with community partners
to create art in the community.</p>
