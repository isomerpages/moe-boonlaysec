<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every BLS student, a World Changer who Wonders and Wanders.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The world is our classroom. Our mission is to craft engaging learning
experiences that equip students with skills that enable them to navigate
a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.</p>

<h4><strong>Humanities Investigation Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In our classroom, our students are explorers and investigators. Through
the various inquiry based and experiential learning activities, our students
discover first-hand the world around them and learn the relevance of Humanities
in their everyday life. Harnessing technology in our lessons, our students
are also exposed to multiple perspectives and are guided to examine societal
issues with a keen eye.</p>
<h4><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong></h4>
<p>Learning Geography is an adventure at Boon Lay. Taking every fieldtrip
as a quest, our students navigate the field, collect data and conduct interviews
to test their hypothesis. Through the Geographical Investigation programme,
students get the chance to visit fieldwork sites such as Botanic Gardens,
Sentosa and Chinatown.</p>

of Singapore and re-enactments of key historical events. Students are exposed
to various interesting artefacts to enhance their knowledge about the history
of Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>Humanities Aspiration Programme</strong></h4>

to represent the school in programmes organised by the National Library
Board and National University of Singapore.</p>
