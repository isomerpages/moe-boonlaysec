<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every student a&nbsp;learner who uses language with&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>mpact,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>ffect
and&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ffect.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>English Language is a language of beauty and power.</p>
<p>It is our goal to empower students to become proficient and confident
users of the language, as well as to enjoy learning it. To complement the
explicit teaching of language skills, we design close, extensive and critical
reading and viewing experiences to immerse students in a rich language
environment. We value thinking and use frameworks like Thinking Hats to
promote diversified thinking in a language classroom. Students will also
be given ample opportunities to use the language effectively in a variety
of contexts through collaborative work with their peers and oral performance
tasks.</p>

<h4><br><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>BLSTV</strong></h5>
<p>BLSTV was conceptualised as a language programme aimed to facilitate authentic
learning experiences in language classrooms and beyond, and create opportunities
for students to develop 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies and outcomes,
ie. confidence, creativity, collaboration and communication skills.</p>
<p>Students are empowered to take the lead in creating and hosting various
types of content, including live news broadcasts and interviews. Leveraging
the affordances of IT, school news, events, and achievements are presented
in a fun and attention-grabbing format that revolutionises the way students
perceive morning assemblies and engage with its content.</p>
<p>Students also hone new media literacies which are crucial in the digital
age. Each production stage provides a real-life context for students to
apply their individual skillsets to the roles and tasks assigned to them.</p>

<h5><strong>Reading Programme by Ex-Libris</strong></h5>
<p>Across the 4-5 years, students get to read different genres and topics
through customised reading materials. They also have access to curated
articles and stories which are followed up with reading activities. They
read so that they can actively respond to current issues and topics through
reading circles, online discussions or creative tasks in the form of videologues
and podcasts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s library has been revamped to become a learning hub of the
future. In this new inviting environment, our students not only open new
doors to a world of knowledge through reading, but also use the different
learning spaces to engage in various social and informational activities.
Our students love to frequent it as the different spaces allow them to
connect with their peers, or simply enjoy individual quiet time where they
can read and recharge.</p>
<h5><strong>Oracy: Stand and Deliver from dialogues to speeches</strong></h5>
<p>Students participate in different performance tasks and oral enrichment
activities each year so that they gradually develop confidence to communicate
effectively to different audiences. The Lower Secondary students will get
opportunities to express themselves through language and motion by participating
in activities like Choral Reading, Readers’ Theatre and Theatre. The Upper
Secondary students will be introduced to debating and public speaking to
develop as persuasive speakers where they also hone their communication
skills such as pronunciation, fluency and rhythm in their speeches.</p>
<h5><strong>Aspiration: Exploring their futures in English</strong></h5>
<p>As part of the Student Development programme, we run various workshops
for students ranging from journalism, emceeing to film-making. Through
these workshops, students explore their dreams of becoming journalists,
emcees and filmmakers. School events like Total Defence Day, Aspire and
Achieve Day are platforms for these students to do professional emceeing
before a live audience. Aspiring journalists also get a chance to conduct
interviews and contribute to the school’s newsletter, Arise. Beyond what
they are exposed to in the classrooms, students are encouraged to join
these workshops to explore how English holds the power of communicating
ideas and shaping minds.</p>

<p>In Literature lessons, students will develop a deeper love and appreciation
of the written words through drama, journal writing and creative tasks
to enhance their interaction with rich literary works.</p>

<p>2021 remains exciting for the students as local writers and poets connected
with the Upper Secondary students at Words Go Round 2021. A group of Lower
and Upper Secondary students also took up the challenge of participating
in the following events organised by the National Schools Literature Festival
(NSLF) 2021:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Lower Sec Choral Reading Speaking competition&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Secondary Unseen Debate&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flash Fiction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4 of our Sec 3 students participated in the Unseen Debate Competition
in the National Schools Literature Festival 2021. They have done BLS proud
by putting forth strong, well-supported arguments and emerging as the winners!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, “Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment,
until it becomes a memory.” Yes, indeed this competition is a treasurable
memory for me! Being chosen as the debater for BLS was quite a huge burden
on me, but I’m grateful for my teammates as well as my teachers who truly
motivated our team to keep going. In the end, this perseverance paid off,
we won!
