<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Every student a&nbsp;learner who uses language with&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>mpact,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>ffect
and&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ffect.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>English Language is a language of beauty and power.</p>
<p>It is our goal to empower students to become proficient and confident
users of the language, as well as to enjoy learning it. To complement the
explicit teaching of language skills, we design close, extensive and critical
reading and viewing experiences to immerse students in a rich language
environment. We value thinking and use frameworks like Thinking Hats to
promote diversified thinking in a language classroom. Students will also
be given ample opportunities to use the language effectively in a variety
of contexts through collaborative work with their peers and writing and
oral performance tasks.</p>

<h4><strong>Performance Tasks as Alternative Assessments</strong></h4>
<p>We are committed to developing future-ready students by providing opportunities
for them to undertake performance tasks that progressively challenge their
language and digital competencies from Secondary 1 to 3. Guided and facilitated
by teachers, students work individually, in pairs, and in groups to create
illustrated stories, podcasts, and videologues or vodcasts. These tasks
not only enhance their technological skills but also nurture their creativity,
collaboration, and critical thinking skills, preparing them to thrive in
a dynamic and interconnected world.</p>

<h3><br><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>BLSTV</strong></h4>
<p>BLSTV was conceptualised as a language programme aimed to facilitate authentic
learning experiences in language classrooms and beyond, and create opportunities
for students to develop 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies and outcomes,
ie. confidence, creativity, collaboration and communication skills.</p>
<p>Students are empowered to take the lead in creating and hosting various
types of content, including live news broadcasts and interviews. Leveraging
the affordances of IT, school news, events, and achievements are presented
in a fun and attention-grabbing format that revolutionises the way students
perceive morning assemblies and engage with its content.</p>
<p>Students also hone digital competencies which are crucial in the digital
age. Each production stage provides a real-life context for students to
apply their individual skillsets to the roles and tasks assigned to them.</p>

<h4><strong>ELITe Fest</strong></h4>
<p>ELITe Fest is Boon Lay Secondary School's vibrant celebration of the English
Language, where students immerse themselves in a week of engaging and creative
activities. From solving Daily Crossword Puzzles to crafting compelling
one-paragraph Flash Fiction narratives, the week is packed with opportunities
for students to showcase their language skills.</p>
<p>Highlights include recording sports commentary voice overs for video clips,
designing quizzes, and delivering persuasive sales pitch presentations
for imagined games. The festivities culminate in an exciting game show
grand finale, where the school's four Houses compete in a spirited series
of English challenges, showcasing teamwork, wit, and a love for language.</p>

<h4><strong>Oracy Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Students participate in different performance tasks and oral enrichment
activities each year so that they gradually develop confidence to communicate
effectively to different audiences. The Lower Secondary students will get
opportunities to express themselves through language and motion by participating
in activities like Choral Reading and Readers’ Theatre. The Upper Secondary
students will be introduced to debating and public speaking to develop
as persuasive speakers where they also hone their delivery skills such
as pronunciation, fluency and rhythm in their speeches.</p>

<h5><strong>Aspiration: Exploring their futures in English</strong></h5>
<p>As part of the Student Development programme, we run various workshops
for students ranging from journalism, emceeing to film-making. Through
these workshops, students explore their dreams of becoming journalists,
emcees and filmmakers. School events like Total Defence Day, Aspire and
Achieve Day are platforms for these students to do professional emceeing
before a live audience. Aspiring journalists also get a chance to conduct
interviews and contribute to the school’s newsletter, Arise. Beyond what
they are exposed to in the classrooms, students are encouraged to join
these workshops to explore how English holds the power of communicating
ideas and shaping minds.</p>

<p>In Literature lessons, students will develop a deeper love and appreciation
of the written words through drama, journal writing and creative tasks
to enhance their interaction with rich literary works.</p>

<p>2021 remains exciting for the students as local writers and poets connected
with the Upper Secondary students at Words Go Round 2021. A group of Lower
and Upper Secondary students also took up the challenge of participating
in the following events organised by the National Schools Literature Festival
(NSLF) 2021:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Lower Sec Choral Reading Speaking competition&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Secondary Unseen Debate&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>4 of our Sec 3 students participated in the Unseen Debate Competition
in the National Schools Literature Festival 2021. They have done BLS proud
by putting forth strong, well-supported arguments and emerging as the winners!</p>
