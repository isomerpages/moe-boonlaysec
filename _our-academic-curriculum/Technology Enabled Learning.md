<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Apple Distinguished School</strong></h4>
<p>We’re pleased to be recognized as an Apple Distinguished School for 2024–2027
for inspiring, imagining, and impacting teaching and learning schoolwide
through continuous innovation.</p>

<h4><strong>Create, Connect and Contribute</strong></h4>
<p>At Boon Lay Secondary School, our teachers design varied learning experiences
for our students to be creators, connectors and contributors. Through a
variety of lessons from self-paced modular academic curriculum modules
to authentic multidisciplinary lessons, our students are equipped with
the necessary skills to navigate the increasingly digital VUCA world.</p>

<h4><strong>Personal Learning Device</strong></h4>
<p>The school will be using the Apple iPad (A16) Wi-Fi for teaching and learning
from 2026. The device bundle consists of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apple iPad (A16) Wi-Fi 128 GB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stylus: Apple Pencil (USB-C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protective Casing and Keyboard: Logitech Combo Touch iPad 11” (A16) [1
year Warranty]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 years warranty (covers 2 repairs or 1 replacement)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after
subsidies have been granted.</p>
<p>Students who do not wish to purchase a PLD through the school because
they already have their own iPads will have to check with the school (ICT
Helpdesk at the School Library) to ascertain whether the specifications
of their existing devices meet the schools’ requirements. All student-owned
devices must also be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA)
software to manage the student’s access and usage.</p>
<h4><strong>Device Management Application</strong></h4>
<p>Please note that&nbsp;<strong>the PLD&nbsp;will&nbsp;be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA)</strong>.
The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD
in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA
has 3 main components:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Classroom Management Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile Device Management Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usage Management Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Continuing the default school settings</strong> after school hours
is the best option for parents/guardians who prefer not to, or do not feel
ready to manage their child’s/ward’s device use on their own.</p>
<p>Parents may contact the school&nbsp;<a href="mailto:blss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blss@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;if you would like
to update the after school hours for your child/ward's DMA (please include
DMA in your email subject)</p>
