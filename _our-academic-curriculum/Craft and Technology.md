<h4>Design Thinking in Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</h4>
<p>At Boon Lay Secondary School, our lower secondary students engage in a
dynamic, learner-centred approach to Design and Technology (D&amp;T). They
actively participate in the entire design process, from exploring diverse
design possibilities to expressing their unique creativity. Through hands-on
experiences, students iteratively test and refine their ideas, learning
valuable lessons from setbacks and applying improvements. This process
not only hones their design skills but also fosters a growth mindset, resilience,
and problem-solving abilities, preparing them for future challenges in
a rapidly evolving world.</p>

<p><strong>Young Innovatorsâ€™ Fair 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The D&amp;T curriculum is designed to cultivate students' critical, adaptive,
and inventive thinking, along with enhancing their communication skills.
A prime example of this was when Sec 3 D&amp;T students participated in
the MOE Innovation Program and were selected to present their prototype
at the Young Innovators' Fair 2024. During the event, they articulated
the design rationale behind their prototype and demonstrated how it could
be used in various real-world scenarios. The panel of experts provided
valuable feedback and suggestions for further improvement, allowing students
to refine their work. By engaging in this program, they not only showcased
their technical and problem-solving abilities but also honed their presentation
and interpersonal skills, preparing them for future challenges in an increasingly
complex world.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>Food and Consumer Education (FCE)</strong>
</p>
<p>Food and Consumer Education (FCE) equips students with essential life
skills to navigate the complexities of modern living. At the lower secondary
level, students develop practical skills in meal planning, food preparation,
and wise consumer decision-making.</p>
<p>FCE emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving, helping students
to make informed choices in areas such as nutrition, budgeting, and sustainable
living. Through engaging hands-on activities and projects, students learn
the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, managing personal finances,
and contributing to a sustainable environment. This holistic approach prepares
them to be responsible and informed individuals who can thrive in a dynamic
world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)</strong></h3>
<p>Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) equips upper secondary students with
a deeper understanding of the science behind food and its impact on health.
Through hands-on practice and theory, students explore topics such as food
safety, dietary planning, and the properties of food.</p>
<p>They apply scientific principles in preparing nutritious dishes, while
coursework fosters creativity and problem-solving as they design recipes
for specific dietary needs. NFS not only develops essential life skills
but also inspires a passion for health and nutrition, preparing students
for future opportunities in related fields.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Culinary Masterclass with Professional Chefs for Upper Secondary</strong></h3>
<p>Upper secondary students learn from professional chefs through hands-on
workshops and live demonstrations, enhancing their culinary skills and
gaining industry insights to prepare for future opportunities in food and
hospitality.</p>
<p>
<br>

</p>
<h3><strong>Sustainable Consumption: Harvesting Local Greens with Vertical Hydroponics</strong></h3>
<p>Upper secondary students embrace sustainable consumption by harvesting
fresh, locally grown greens from our vertical hydroponics system. This
hands-on experience teaches them about sustainable farming methods, reduces
food miles, and promotes environmental responsibility, while reinforcing
the importance of incorporating nutritious, home-grown produce into their
diets.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Innovative Culinary and Nutrition Programme for Secondary 3</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 Nutrition and Food Science programme empowers students
with advanced culinary skills and a deeper understanding of food science.
Students apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, such as participating
in culinary competitions and exploring innovative recipe development. They
learn to evaluate the nutritional value of meals, focus on sustainable
practices, and develop creative solutions to meet diverse dietary needs,
preparing them for real-world applications and further studies in food
and nutrition.</p>
