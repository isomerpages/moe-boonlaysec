<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every student a creative and critical thinker who possesses empathetic
qualities.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To design engaging learning experiences that equip all students with knowledge,
skills and learning dispositions that provides the foundation for lifelong
learning. With the provision of education technologies, our students experience
authentic learning through the investigation, reflection and creation of
products.</p>
<h4><strong>Implementation of Design Thinking in Design &amp; Technology</strong></h4>
<p>Using a learner-centred approach, lower secondary students are actively
involved in the entire design process, given the choices to explore various
design possibilities and freedom to express their creativity. Students
get to test their ideas and mock up iteratively, learning from failures
and making improvements, promoting a growth mindset and resilience while
developing design skills.</p>
