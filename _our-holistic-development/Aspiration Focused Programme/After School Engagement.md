<p>At BLS, we believe in creating opportunities for our students to develop
their strengths and interests, form support networks within the school
community, and rise to his or her potential regardless of background. We
actively engage students in co-creating spaces and programmes, giving them
a voice and choice.</p>

<h4><strong>The Chill Zone</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Chill Zone, housed in our Civil Defence (CD) shelter, was opened
in 2022 and students are free to visit the space during their recess and
lunch breaks as well as after school. This vibrant space was co-created
and meticulously designed with the invaluable input of our students, and
continues to be refreshed annually. From the strategic placement of the
pool table to the selection of gaming consoles, every element reflects
the preferences and desires of our students who utilize the space. The
flight simulator, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and other amenities were chosen
with a keen understanding of the diverse interests within the student body.
Musical instruments and table tennis tables were integrated based on the
feedback and suggestions of those who envisioned this space as a multifaceted
retreat. By incorporating the perspectives of the students, the Chill Zone
becomes not just a physical space but a collaborative manifestation of
the community's recreational aspirations and preferences, fostering a sense
of ownership and pride among its users.</p>

<p>Teachers and students run programmes such as ‘Wellness Wednesdays’ and
Inter-house FIFA and Pool Tournaments. In addition, the Chill Zone was
also made available to CCAs upon request to conduct team-bonding activities
to deepen relationships within the CCA.</p>
