<p>At BLS, we believe in creating opportunities for our students to develop
their strengths and interests, form support networks within the school
community, and rise to his or her potential regardless of background. We
actively engage students in co-creating spaces and programmes, giving them
a voice and choice.</p>
<h4><strong>The Chill Zone</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Chill Zone, housed in our Civil Defence (CD) shelter, was opened
in 2022 and students are free to visit the space during their recess and
lunch breaks as well as after school. This vibrant space was co-created
and meticulously designed with the invaluable input of our students, and
continues to be refreshed annually. From the strategic placement of the
pool table to the selection of gaming consoles, every element reflects
the preferences and desires of our students who utilize the space. The
flight simulator, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and other amenities were chosen
with a keen understanding of the diverse interests within the student body.
Musical instruments and table tennis tables were integrated based on the
feedback and suggestions of those who envisioned this space as a multifaceted
retreat. By incorporating the perspectives of the students, the Chill Zone
becomes not just a physical space but a collaborative manifestation of
the community's recreational aspirations and preferences, fostering a sense
of ownership and pride among its users.</p>
<p>Teachers and students run programmes such as ‘Wellness Wednesdays’ and
Inter-house FIFA and Pool Tournaments. In addition, the Chill Zone was
also made available to CCAs upon request to conduct team-bonding activities
to deepen relationships within the CCA.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Academies</strong></h4>
<p>Our after-school academies are grounds-up programmes that focus on sports,
the arts, and tinkering. What makes our Academies unique is the fact that
it is largely student-initiated rather than school-initiated. Students
submit a proposal for an activity they would like to be part of, find like-minded
peers to be part of the interest group and determine what they would like
to learn from the programme. Teacher-mentors are then matched with students
and provide administrative (e.g. sourcing of instructors/ coaches) support
and guidance.</p>
<p>Beyond skill acquisition, these academies contribute significantly to
socio-emotional development. Students navigating the challenges of sports
learn perseverance, while collaborative artistic endeavors cultivate teamwork.
Tinkering, with its focus on experimentation, instills adaptability. Ultimately,
these student-driven academies transcend traditional learning, becoming
crucibles for a well-rounded education that empowers students with not
just knowledge, but a rich tapestry of skills and qualities essential for
a successful and fulfilling future.</p>
<p>Our Sports Academies nurture athleticism, imparting not only sports-based
skills but also fostering teamwork and resilience through Football and
Volleyball. In partnership with Unleash the Roar (UTR), BLS, MGS and WWSS
have forged a centre-based School Football Academy for girls. Twice a week,
girls from varying backgrounds train at BLS under the guidance of coaches
from UTR to hone their skills and foster camaraderie. In 2023, the combined
C Division girls' team secured a 3rd place at the C Division National School
Games. This collaboration has given girls with an interest in football
an opportunity to deepen their skills, fostered friendships and also strengthened
bonds between schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arts academies are incubators for creativity, offering a canvas for
self-expression and the acquisition of new artistic skills such as Street
Dance. The rhythmic movements to the latest KPop hits enhance coordination,
while the collaborative nature of group dances fosters teamwork. The fusion
of diverse styles not only amplifies individual abilities but also forges
a collective spirit, showcasing the transformative power of dance education.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, our tinkering academies provide a hands-on platform for
innovation, honing problem-solving abilities. Students with an interest
in growing their own food gain hands-on experience in growing unique produce
such as Beefsteak Tomatotes, Edamame and Japanese Sweet Corn. Beyond growing
produce, the programme instills patience as students witness the gradual
journey from seed to plate.</p>
