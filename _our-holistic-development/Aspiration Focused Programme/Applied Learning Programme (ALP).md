<h4><strong>Programme and Key Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The ALP in BLS is organised in two tiers. The Tier 1 programme is a 10-hour
programme comprising a set of computational thinking workshop for all Secondary
1, and application of ALP skill and knowledge in VIA projects for all Secondary
2 students. Through these modules, students acquire basic coding knowledge
and develop STE(A)M-related skills, communication and collaborative skills,
critical thinking and creativity.</p>

<p>Selected Secondary 2 and 3 students interested in pursuing their interest
and developing their STE(A)M-related skills are identified for the Tier
2 programme, where they have opportunities to deepen and broaden their
knowledge in the field and are challenged to apply their knowledge in projects
and competitions. Students will also be invited for industry visits and
have opportunities to interact with professionals in the field.</p>

<p>Our ALP curriculum is guided by our 3’A’ Framework –&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>cquisition,&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ppreciation
and&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>pplication. Using an inquiry-based approach,
students&nbsp;<strong><em>acquire</em></strong>&nbsp;(i) knowledge on a
diverse range of materials through hands-on activities, group discussions,
online research, as well as the (ii) problem solving and experimental skills
required for them to carry out sound scientific investigations. Through
mini-research projects, students are kept abreast with the developments
in the field of Materials Science, and at the same time develop an&nbsp;<strong><em>appreciation</em></strong>&nbsp;for
the innovative use of materials in everyday life. Design challenges provide
students with the opportunity to&nbsp;<strong><em>apply</em></strong>&nbsp;their
knowledge and skills to improve on existing products or to invent new ones.</p>

<p>Students will engage in self-reflection to identify their strengths and
areas of improvement in the following domains viz. communication skills,
collaborative skills, critical thinking and creativity. During lessons,
students will also be tasked to provide constructive peer critiques on
one another’s presentations and performance.</p>
