In BLS, we strongly believe in supporting our students in the pursuit of their interests, and in working together with them towards their dreams and aspirations. Students will be exposed to a wide range of student development learning experiences and opportunities which will allow them to:

*   Discover their strengths and talents;
*   Pursuit their interests and aspirations;
*   Explore possible career pathways; and
*   Build up a meaningful portfolio to support their aspirations.
