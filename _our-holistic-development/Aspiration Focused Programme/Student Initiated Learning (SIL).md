<h4><strong>Description of Programme &amp; Key Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The SIL programme comprises three tiers of activities designed to cater
to students’ learning preferences and interests:</p>
<p><strong>1. School-Curated Activities for Independent Learning at Home</strong>
</p>
<p>Students have the flexibility to pursue school-curated activities during
Home-Based Learning (HBL) at their own pace. These activities are accessible
via the SIL MS Teams and Student Learning Space (SLS) platforms. They are
designed to be simple, safe, and stress-free, encouraging exploration in
areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swift Playground with Your iPad (Digital and Infotech)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital science experiments (Engineering, Maths, and Science)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Arcade (Sports)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music in Singapore (Arts and Humanities)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; School-Facilitated Activities with Peers</strong>
</p>
<p>Students can return to school during HBL to use school facilities&nbsp;
and engage in hands-on activities collaboratively with their peers. These
activities foster teamwork, enhance practical skills, and allow students
to maximize the use of school resources. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cricut and 3D printing projects in the Design Studio (Media and Design)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports training sessions such as basketball, badminton, or Captain’s Ball
(Sports)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Fully Student-Initiated Activities with Peers</strong>
</p>
<p>In this category, students independently plan and execute activities with
their peers, further developing leadership and collaboration skills. Examples
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modern dance rehearsals (Relations and Business)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizing video production or photography projects (Arts and Humanities)</p>
