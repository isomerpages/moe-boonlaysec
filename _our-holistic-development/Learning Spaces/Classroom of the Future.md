<p>Imagine a classroom that adapts to every learning need. Our classrooms
are designed to flexibly provide spaces for solo study, pair discussions,
group projects, or interactive discussions. Such a dynamic environment
fosters collaboration and the freedom for every student to discover their
best way of learning.</p>

<p>Not only so, our classrooms are also equipped with Apple TVs that help
facilitate collaborative learning by allowing students to share their work,
such as presentations or videos they created with the class.</p>

<p>Our classrooms are thoughtfully designed to have lush artificial plants
and high-quality, comfortable flooring. These design elements have certainly
created a calming environment that promotes focus and mental wellness.</p>
