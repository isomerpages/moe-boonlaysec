<p>The brush pen lettering and origami sessions at the library were really
enjoyable as they allowed me to unleash my creativity. When doing up the
art piece with the brushes, I had to be patient and exercise enough control
in order to create a nice piece of work. The facilities at the library,
like the stage area and the round tables, also made the learning experience
more enjoyable. I enjoyed most the part where we got really creative and
made the paper origami cranes which were then used to decorate the library.
Our library is not just a quiet place for reading, it is also a fun place
to enjoy such activities with schoolmates.</p>
