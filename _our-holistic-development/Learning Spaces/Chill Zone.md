<p>Where do Boonlayians retreat to when they feel the need to unwind? Open
after school and during breaktime, the Chill Zone is the perfect place
to relax at. Students have access to PS5 and Nintendo Switch video game
consoles, pool and table tennis tables, arcade machines, board games, comics
and even a drumming set!</p>

<p>The Chill Zone is a safe space for students to socialise and make memories.
From board games to video games, thereâ€™s always something fun and engaging
to do. Students from different backgrounds come as strangers and leave
as friends. Even teachers join students there to forge stronger relationships.</p>
