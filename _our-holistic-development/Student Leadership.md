<p>At Boon Lay Secondary School (BLS), we believe that leadership is a journey
that begins with every student who walks through our doors. Our Student
Leadership Programme is designed to unlock the potential within each individual,
fostering skills that will serve them well beyond their school years. We
are committed to creating an environment where every student can discover
their strengths, develop their abilities, and gain practical experience
in leadership roles. Through a combination of tiered leadership roles,
comprehensive leadership training, and meaningful developmental assignments,
we aim to nurture confident, compassionate, and capable young leaders ready
to make a positive impact in our school and community.</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Framework</strong></h4>
<p>The BLS Student Leadership Programme is anchored by The Leadership Challenge
Model, a globally recognised framework for developing effective leaders.
Students participate in engaging leadership workshops where they develop
essential leadership skills and competencies. During their leadership tenure,
they are given challenging developmental assignments that provide opportunities
to apply and demonstrate their newly acquired leadership skills in real-world
scenarios. Through this comprehensive programme, we aspire to cultivate
student leaders who can effectively lead, serve, and inspire their peers
and the wider community.</p>

<h4><strong>Tiered Leadership Approach</strong></h4>
<p>At BLS, we firmly believe that every Boon Layian has the potential to
be a leader. To nurture this potential, our Student Leadership Programme
adopts a tiered leadership approach. This structure allows students to
progressively develop their leadership skills, taking on increasingly complex
roles and responsibilities as they grow and mature.</p>

<h4><strong>BLS Student Leaders Council</strong></h4>
<p>Aligned with BLS's unique CCA-House system, the BLS Student Leaders' Council
(SLC) comprises two main groups of leaders: House Leaders and CCA Leaders.
Each group oversees different aspects of school operations and holds distinct
responsibilities. Together, they lead and serve the school population through
their innovative initiatives and dedicated service.</p>

<p>House Leaders play a dual role in our school community. Beyond leading
their respective houses, they contribute significantly to school operations
in their assigned wings. The four wings of house leadership are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student Well-Being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School Spirit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Events</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These wings not only foster teamwork among student leaders but also empower
them to initiate school programmes that celebrate student voice and drive
positive change within our school community.</p>
