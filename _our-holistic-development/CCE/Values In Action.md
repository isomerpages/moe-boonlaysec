<p>Values in Action (VIA) programme in BLS provides a values-driven education
to our students in which each child is given the opportunity to contribute
back to the society progressively (covering four main domains: School,
Community, Nation and World).</p>
<p>Our school adopts the Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) as an approach
for our VIA programme. Partnering with several external organisations for
our VIA programme enhances the experience and fosters a holistic approach
to learning, benefiting both our students and the broader community.</p>
<p>Steering away from the conventional approach of class-organised VIA, the
projects in BLS are helmed by CCA groups. Our CCA-based VIA programme provides
an opportunity for CCA groups to engage a community partner and raise awareness
and/or advocate for the community. Taking a CCA-centric and student-centred
approach in the VIA programme, the CCA-based VIA projects are spearheaded
by Sec Three students and they are mentored by their seniors in Secondary
Four or Five. CCAMs (CCA Teacher Mentors) facilitate and guide students
through the process using the Design Thinking Framework: Empathise, Define,
Ideate, Prototype &amp; Evaluate.</p>
<p>Through the VIA journey, the synergy of these collaborations and the activation
of knowledge from the Applied Learning Programme empower students to forge
meaningful connections with partners. This process equips them to harness
technology and creativity effectively, addressing real-world challenges
through Design Thinking. The impact of our VIA and VIA-ALP programme has
been well-recognised and appreciated by our partners.</p>

<p>The structured learning experiences and hands-on opportunities to serve
the community have enabled our students to be more aware of the varying
needs in the community. CCA-based VIA provides a platform for students
with common skills and interests to work together to make a difference
to the community. Teachers noted that working together on a project, aside
from CCA duties, helps to develop team spirit among the students who also
forge closer bonds with their CCA mentors and peers in the CCA.</p>
<p>We have seen our students grow and develop into socially responsible individuals
able to lead with empathy. We hope that the experience gained from the
VIA projects will plant the seed of compassion in our students, so that
they will continue to reach out and help the various communities beyond
secondary school.</p>
