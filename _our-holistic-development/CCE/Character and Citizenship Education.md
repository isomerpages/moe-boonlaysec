<p>At Boon Lay Secondary School (BLS), Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) adopts an integrated approach to nurturing our students' values,
character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in
a cohesive and holistic manner. Our goal is to equip every student with
the knowledge, skills, and values needed to grow into confident leaders
of empathy, guided by sound principles, and committed to contributing meaningfully
to the school, community, and nation.</p>
<p>In essence: Every BoonLayian – a Confident Youth, a Concerned Citizen,
and an Empathetic Leader.</p>
<h4><strong>Structure</strong></h4>
<p>BLS has redesigned CCE to be based on CCAs by level. The spiral CCE curriculum
is conducted by CCAMs in a CCA-Centric Model. With this approach, students
get to hear more perspectives during cross-stream (CCA pairing by levels)
or cross-stream, cross-level (by CCAs) discussions.</p>
