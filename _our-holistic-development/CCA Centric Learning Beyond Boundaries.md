<p>CCA-centric Learning Beyond Boundaries (CCLBB) programme is Boon Lay Secondary
School’s global education programme. With its focus on promoting&nbsp;<strong>responsible global citizenry,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>communication and collaboration,</strong>&nbsp;CCLBB
aims to develop the student into a/an:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Self-Directed Learner</strong>&nbsp;who interacts with others
to construct knowledge, new understandings and ideas;
<br>2. <strong>Active Contributor</strong>&nbsp;who is able to determine and
effectively assume the role he/she will play in a group, and work in a
respectful manner with others in a group setting to meet the group’s goals;
<br>3. <strong>Confident Person</strong>&nbsp;who is able to demonstrate appropriate
skills and behavior to work together with people from a diverse range of
backgrounds within and beyond Singapore;
<br>4. <strong>Concerned Citizen</strong>&nbsp;who demonstrates awareness of
Singapore’s role in addressing issues in the global community.</p>
<p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the CCLBB programme has taken on a virtual
approach, connecting BoonLayians with their peers in overseas partner schools
through meaningful online projects and interaction sessions.</p>
