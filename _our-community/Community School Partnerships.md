<p>At BLS, we believe in cultivating a safe and healthy environment for children,
one that provides the necessary security to grow and succeed. We recognise
that there are resources beyond the school, and within the wider community
that we should harness in achieving this goal. Hence, we actively reach
out to a far-reaching network of industrial and community partners to establish
mutually beneficial partnerships that can support the diverse needs of
our students and nurture their aspirations.</p>

<p>As much as they benefit from this community, our students also have a
duty to contribute back positively, and to see themselves as confident
future leaders and agents of positive change. To raise capacity and ensure
that we support the diverse needs of our students and staff in a sustainable
manner, we have been proactive in forging strong partnerships that align
to our school’s mission and vision.</p>
<p>Our unique approach to forging partnerships is as follows:</p>
