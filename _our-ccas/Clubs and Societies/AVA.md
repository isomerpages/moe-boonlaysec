<p>The Audio Video Aid (AVA) club provides essential audio and video services
for all the school events. We are involved in major school events such
as the festive celebrations, Awards Ceremony, Teachers' Day, National Day,
Graduation Ceremony, and Recess Concerts. The club is also responsible
in ensuring that the equipment is functional during morning and school
assemblies, and other ad-hoc events.</p>
<p>Through the demands of the events, the students learn about the importance
of being responsible, punctuality and teamwork. Leadership skills are also
developed as the students learn to communicate effectively, manage events,
and delegate roles to different members. As a result, AVA members have
become a closely knitted group, demonstrating strong teamwork in ensuring
that each event flows seamlessly.</p>
<p>The weekly technical equipment training allows the students to hone their
technical skills in operating them. In addition to these trainings, the
club also conducts learning journeys, embarks on projects and challenges
for students to discover their true potential, to build self-confidence
and tenacity within.</p>
<p>Come join us if you have an interest in learning more about the use of
the AV equipment!</p>
