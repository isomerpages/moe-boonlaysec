<p>Anchored in promoting digital literacy, CyberAce is an Infocomm and Technology
(IT) club that equips students with practical skills in coding, design,
and photography. Through hands-on learning and real-world applications,
members explore these three disciplines while sharpening their logical
and creative thinking abilities.</p>
<p>In photography, students capture key moments during school events and
learn to tell stories through visuals. In design, students use Canva and
Sketchbook to create engaging publicity materials for the school’s social
media pages. In programming, students take on coding challenges using Lego
Spike Prime, strengthening their problem-solving and computational thinking
skills. Seniors actively guide juniors, while leaders take the initiative
to teach and share their knowledge during CCA sessions.</p>
<p>Members are encouraged to participate in external competitions such as
Lego Spike Prime, IgnITE Skills Challenge, Our Schools, Our Story gaining
valuable experience and earning LEAPS 2.0 points through their involvement
and achievements. Leadership is also emphasised. The Executive Committee
members plan and lead activities such as Bonding Day and Values-in-Action
projects, learning to manage the club under the guidance of teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students develop essential 21st Century Competencies
(21CC) such as communication, collaboration and critical thinking. CyberAce
provides a platform for members to grow in confidence, creativity, and
independence, while fostering teamwork, leadership, and unity. Above all,
it offers opportunities for fun, friendship, and exploration in the exciting
world of digital technology.</p>
