<p>CyberAce is an Infocomm and Technology (IT) club that focuses on equipping
members with knowledge and skills in coding, media and photography. Club
members not only hone these skills but also sharpen their logical and creative
thinking abilities.</p>
<p>Through the various contributions via the club activities and school events,
members develop a great sense of responsibility and discipline in their
respective teams. The Photography Team captures important moments during
school events while the Design Team uses applications such as Inkscape
to produce publicity materials for the schoolâ€™s social media pages. Using
the Lego Mindstorm EV3, the Robotics Team gets to stretch their ability
in the area of coding. Also, the club actively seeks opportunities for
its members to challenge themselves in external competitions such as the
Lego Mindstorm, Digital Storytelling and many others. Participation in
these competitions helps them in accumulating LEAPS 2.0 points through
their involvement or achievements.</p>
<p>Leadership is another area which we emphasise on. The executive committee
members of the Cyberace Club are given platforms to hone their planning
and leadership skills by running the club under the guidance of the teachers-in-charge.
Events that the executive committee members have organised include Bonding
Day and the Values In Action activities. They also assist in the planning
and running of CCA sessions.</p>
<p>CyberAce Club offers a platform for members to grow in confidence, creativity
and independence, and provides opportunities for fun and relationship building
at the same time. Do join us and explore the world of digital technology!</p>
