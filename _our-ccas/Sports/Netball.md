<p>BLS Team Netball is a CCA that nurtures teamwork, resilience, and a passion
for excellence. Our training sessions, held on Tuesdays and Fridays, focus
on diverse methods, from skill development to strength and endurance training,
ensuring each player is well-prepared for upcoming matches and competitions.
Off the court, team members remain active by participating in internal
sports events like Games Day and thrive in other competitions like the
Thinking Challenge, Strategems, and photo-taking contests, celebrating
creativity and strategic thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netball also plays a vital role in building character and developing skills
aligned with 21st Century Competencies. Guided by our motto, 'Every Netballer
a Leader,' each student chooses a unique role upon joining Secondary 1,
which they continue to develop throughout their journey until graduation.
These roles extend beyond Netball-specific duties, embracing each student’s
talents, passions, and skills. Students can take on roles such as Captain,
Vice-Captain, Aesthetics Head, Events Director, or Lead Speaker as they
are empowered to contribute in diverse ways such as mentoring their juniors
and leading the team both on and off the court.</p>
<p>Both our B and C Division teams participate in the National Schools Games
(NSG) Netball Inter-School Competitions, Netball Singapore’s Year End Carnival
as well as Deloitte Pesta Sukan Tournament annually. During these competitions,
the Netball team players are given the opportunity to showcase values such
as perseverance and resilience.</p>
<p>The team organises friendly matches with other schools through active
collaboration. Through these competitions and friendly games, our players
are able to build strong camaraderie while at the same time pit their talents
against other teams.</p>
<p>BLS Team Netball will continue to adapt, evolve, persevere and strive
for greater heights to ensure that each player achieves her best version
and grows as a player, a leader, and a supportive teammate.</p>
