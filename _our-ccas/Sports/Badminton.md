<p>Inspired by the National School Games (NSG) motto, the Boon Lay Secondary
School Badminton Team embodies the spirit of “Character in Sporting Excellence”,
recognising how sports nurture character while driving the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Guided by their own motto, “Smashing Limits”, the team is committed to
building upon past achievements and striving for even greater success.
With unwavering dedication, teamwork, and the steadfast support of teachers-in-charge
and stakeholders, the team continues to bring pride and honour to the school.</p>
<p>Each year, the ‘B’ Division and ‘C’ Division boys’ and girls’ teams represent
Boon Lay Secondary at the NSG, competing with pride, passion, and sportsmanship.
Through every match, they display discipline, resilience, and a genuine
eagerness to learn—growing in confidence as they take on new challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond the court, our players also give back to the community through
Values in Action (VIA) projects, applying Design Thinking to create meaningful
solutions to real-world problems.</p>

of our family of Smashing Limits!</p>
