<p>Aligned with the motto of the National School Games (NSG), the Boon Lay
Secondary School Badminton team embraces ‘Character in Sporting Excellence’,
recognising the vital role sports play in shaping the character of students
alongside their pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>The team’s own motto, ‘Smashing Limits’, reflects our commitment to building
on past successes and striving for greater achievements. With this in mind,
the team is determined to continue bringing pride and glory to the school,
supported by the dedication, commitment, and teamwork of players, teachers-in-charge,
and various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Each year, the ‘B’ Division and ‘C’ Division boys' and girls' teams compete
fiercely in the NSG, representing the school with pride and passion. Throughout
the competitions, the teams demonstrate discipline, resilience, and a strong
eagerness to learn, growing in confidence as they tackle challenges head-on.
Beyond their sporting pursuits, they actively contribute to the community
through meaningful Values in Action (VIA) projects, leveraging Design Thinking
to address and solve real-world issues.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to grow, compete, and contribute, come join our family
of Smashing Limits!</p>
