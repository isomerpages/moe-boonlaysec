<p>Boon Lay Secondary School Basketball Team strives to nurture its players
into both effective leaders and dedicated team players, on and off the
court. Beyond honing basketball skills and game strategies, the team’s
student development plan places strong emphasis on leadership growth, teamwork,
perseverance, and commitment.</p>
<p>The team embraces the joy of sports and the spirit of continuous improvement.
While training sessions and competitions can be challenging, these experiences
— together with various team activities and events — foster meaningful
bonds and lasting memories for all members.</p>
<p>Each year, the team competes in the National School Games (NSG) West Zone
Basketball Championships. In 2025, our ‘C’ Division boys proudly competed
in the NSG League 3 Basketball Championships (out of seven leagues).</p>
<p>Beyond the court, the team actively participates in Values in Action (VIA)
programmes. A recent project, “Adopt a Block,” involved serving and connecting
with residents in the community — assisting the elderly with daily challenges
such as locating keys or opening doors, and engaging them through door-to-door
visits and poster distributions.</p>
<p>Team BLS Basketball looks forward to another exciting and fulfilling year
ahead, continuing to grow in skill, character, and camaraderie.</p>
