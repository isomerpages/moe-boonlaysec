<p>Boon Lay Secondary School Basketball team aims to develop the basketball
players to be leaders and team players on and off the court. In its student
development programme, beyond developing the students in basketball skills
and game strategies, the team also places importance on leadership development,
building team work, perseverance and dedication.</p>
<p>The team believes in the joy of sports pursuit,&nbsp;basketball. The basketball
training sessions and competitions may be demanding, but these sessions,
and together with the other team activities and events, create positive
and lasting sporting experiences for the boys.</p>
<p>Annually, the team participates in the National School Games (NSG) West
Zone Basketball championships.</p>
<p>The team is also active in the Values in Action (VIA) education. One of
its recent VIA project was to learn more about energy efficiency in Singapore,
and raise awareness&nbsp;about&nbsp;energy conservation and climate change.
The message was shared with the school&nbsp;during one of the&nbsp;morning
assemblies. We also interacted with&nbsp;the residents in the community,
through door-to-door sharings, and the distribution of posters and souvenirs
with energy conservation messages attached to them.</p>
<p>Due to Covid-19, 2021&nbsp;was a difficult year for many. However, it
was also&nbsp;during&nbsp;this period that the team further demonstrated
its perseverance, dedication and determination to excel in the sport. During
the e-CCA training sessions, the boys practiced their basketball drills
and footwork, built up their stamina through&nbsp;physical&nbsp;trainings,
all from the comfort and safety of their homes.</p>
<p>As we move forward to 2022, Team BLS basketball&nbsp;is looking&nbsp;forward
to another memorable and exciting year.</p>
