<p>Boon Lay Secondary School Basketball team aims to develop the basketball
players to be leaders and team players on and off the court. In its student
development programme, beyond developing the students in basketball skills
and game strategies, the team also places importance on leadership development,
building team work, perseverance and dedication.</p>
<p>The team believes in the joy of sports pursuit. The basketball training
sessions and competitions may be demanding, but these sessions, along with
other team activities and events, create positive and lasting sporting
experiences for the boys.</p>
<p>Annually, the team participates in the National School Games (NSG) West
Zone Basketball championships.</p>
<p>The team is also active in the Values in Action (VIA) education. One of
its recent VIA project was to learn more about energy efficiency in Singapore
and raise awareness&nbsp;about&nbsp;energy conservation and climate change.
The message was shared with the school&nbsp;during one of the&nbsp;morning
assemblies. We also interacted with&nbsp;the residents in the community
through door-to-door sharings and distributed posters and souvenirs which
promoted energy conservation.</p>
<p>Team BLS basketball&nbsp;is looking&nbsp;forward to another memorable
and exciting year ahead.</p>
