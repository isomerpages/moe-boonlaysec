<p>With the mission of developing its members to be active citizens and community
leaders, the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) serves as a platform to
harness and mould the leadership competencies of its members. This is achieved
through a wide spectrum of activities that develop values such as teamwork,
creative thinking and conflict resolution that are necessary for today’s
society.</p>
<p>Whilst training may be rigorous at times, it is through these tough times
that our members’ character and values are formed, specifically during
the drills and camp craft sessions that continue to play an integral role
in the NPCC identity.</p>
<h4>Self-directed Lifelong Learner</h4>
<p>The journey <strong>to seek Wisdom</strong> starts with inculcating the
correct values in our members. Our members take ownership of their learning,
picking up technical skills and acquiring knowledge critical for their
growth in NPCC.</p>
<h4>Resilient Person</h4>
<p>Our members develop social skills via their exposure to various student
enrichment programmes such as air pistol course, basic sport climbing and
kayaking exposure. These varied experiences promote team spirit and communication.
These skills develop our members to be valiant and resilient individuals
in their aspirations to <strong>strive for Excellence</strong>.</p>
<h4>Empathetic Communicator</h4>
<p>Our members care about the school and the community. They impact the school
by organising the annual Community Safety &amp; Security Programme as well
as the community by raising awareness on crime prevention in public spaces
in the Police Youth Ambassador Programme. Our members learn to <strong>Respect others</strong> and
work in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to keep Singapore safe.</p>
<h4>Responsible Global Citizen</h4>
<p>Engaging the head, heart, and hands of our members, they develop into
visionary leaders who are forward thinking by beginning with the end in
mind. With this mind-set, our members are encouraged to be attuned with
the needs of the community and seek proactive steps to ameliorate the issues
identified <strong>to Honour their words and deeds</strong>.</p>
