<p>With the mission of developing its members to be active citizens and community
leaders, National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) serves as a platform to harness
and mould the leadership competencies of its members. This is achieved
through a wide spectrum of activities that transpire values that are necessary
for today’s society such as teamwork, creative thinking and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Whilst training may be rigorous at times, it is through these tough times
that our members’ character and values are formed, specifically during
the drills and camp craft sessions that continue to play an integral role
in the NPCC identity.</p>
<h4>Self-directed Learner</h4>
<p>The pinnacle of excellence starts with inculcating the correct values
in our members. Our members take ownership of their learning, picking up
technical skills and acquiring knowledge critical for their growth in NPCC.</p>
<h4>Confident Person</h4>
<p>Our members develop social skills via their exposure to various student
enrichment programmes such as air pistol course, basic sport climbing and
kayaking exposure. These varied experiences promote team spirit, communication
and respect. These values mould our members to be valiant and confident
individuals.</p>
<h4>Concerned Citizen</h4>
<p>Our members care about the school and the community. They impact the school
by organising the annual Community Safety &amp; Security Programme as well
as the community by raising awareness on crime prevention in public spaces
in the Police Youth Ambassador Programme. Our members work in partnership
with the Singapore Police Force to keep Singapore safe.</p>
<h4>Active Contributor</h4>
<p>Engaging the head, heart and hands of our members, they gain wisdom and
strive to bring honour to NPCC. They develop into visionary leaders which
are forward thinking by beginning with the end in mind. With this mindset,
our members are encouraged to be attuned with the needs of the community
and seek proactive steps to ameliorate the issues identified.</p>
