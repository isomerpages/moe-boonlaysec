<p>The mission of the National Cadet Corps is to nurture inspiring leaders
and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities.
In Boon Lay Secondary School, the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Unit believes
that our cadets need to embody the NCC core values of Loyalty to Country,
Leadership, Uprightness, Commitment and Responsibility, Adventurous Spirit,
Discipline, and Care. These core values drive the cadets in their endeavour
in achieving excellence for the unit as well as for themselves.</p>
<p>Our belief in the mission as well as through the constant hard work of
all in the unit has led to it being awarded a Distinction in the Unit Recognition
Award for many years.</p>
<p>The unit is also actively involved in the numerous activities organised
by HQ NCC such as the Inter-unit Football Tournament, and Freestyle Drill
Competition. This helps the cadets gain a greater awareness of what’s happening
in the corps as well as form greater friendships with cadets from other
units.</p>
<p>In addition, the Unit also organises activities and events such as the
Annual Camp, which serve to bring invaluable experiences to its cadets.</p>
<p>So please come and join the NCC (Land) family to enjoy all the wonderful
and unique experiences that await you.</p>
