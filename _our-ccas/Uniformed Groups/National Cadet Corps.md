<p>NCC, supported by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Education
(MOE), is one of the largest youth uniformed groups in Singapore. The mission
of the National Cadet Corps is to nurture inspiring leaders and committed
citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities. The
NCC cadet training syllabus includes general military knowledge, as well
as adventure training and leadership development.</p>
<p>Cadets in the unit will undergo the rigorous NCC curriculum, learning
foot drills, individual field craft (IFC) and navigation. By doing so,
cadets will gradually progress from Junior Cadet to Senior Cadet and eventually
to Senior Cadet Leader, growing in rank and responsibility.</p>
<p>The unit is also actively involved in the numerous activities organised
by HQ NCC such as the District Sports Championship, and the Freestyle Drill
Competition. This helps the cadets gain a greater awareness of what is
happening in the corps as well as form friendships with cadets from other
units.</p>
<p>In addition, the unit also organises activities and events such as the
Annual Camp, which serve to bring invaluable experiences to its cadets.</p>
<p>So come and join the NCC (Land) family. All the wonderful and unique experiences
await you.</p>
