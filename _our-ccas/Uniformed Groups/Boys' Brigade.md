<p>The vision of the Boys’ Brigade (BB) is to be the youth organisation of
choice, with the aim to nurture youth, based on Christian values to serve
and lead.</p>
<p>Our Boys’ Brigade, the 82nd Company, serves the community through events
such as BB CARES (Community Activities Rallying Everyone to Serve) and
BB Share-a-Gift, spreading joy to the less fortunate. The 82nd Company
also participates in many events and competitions every year, including
the BB Blaze and Character Quest, which are island-wide competitions where
schools across Singapore compete against one another.</p>
<p>The company instills discipline and teamwork through activities such as
the annual expedition and kayaking. Its comprehensive programme of life
skills such as first aid, community service, drills and campcraft, moulds
them to be well-rounded individuals. Its robust training programme and
achievements see it garnering the J M Fraser Award for Company Excellence
every year.</p>
<p>The 82nd Boys’ Brigade Company seeks to grow from strength to strength,
and nurture new and current members into better boys by instilling the
values of obedience, discipline and self-respect into them, so as to better
prepare them for challenges that may come their way in the future.</p>
