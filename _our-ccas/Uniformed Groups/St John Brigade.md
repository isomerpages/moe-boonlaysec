<p>St John Brigade (SJB) is the uniformed branch of St John Singapore, which

<p><em>SJB Day</em>
</p>
<p>The objective of the Brigade is to combine individual efforts for the
public good, by rendering first aid to the sick and wounded on public occasions,
and to develop and promote every means of rendering aid to the sick and
wounded.</p>
<p>BLS SJB seeks to equip all cadets with life-saving skills of first aid,
nursing, occupational safety, health care and emergency assistance, and
at the same time, provides opportunities to help them develop holistically
as a person. Life-saving courses such as CPR-AED and Basic Cardiac Life
Support (BCLS) are organized for the cadets including certification in
Basic First Aid and Basic Home Nursing. Through the Cadet Proficiency Badge
Scheme (CPBS), the cadets achieve different badges upon completion of the
various internal and external courses. The Chief Commissioner’s Badge,
which is the highest award that a cadet can achieve under CPBS, is presented
to cadets who have attained the required number of badges and successfully
completed various assessments.</p>

<p><em>Boon Lay Secondary School SJB Corps</em>

<p>Our training also includes foot drills which helps to instill discipline
in the students. Aligned to the goals of SJB, our unit provides first aid
services not only to the school, but also to the public by performing public
duties at community events.</p>
