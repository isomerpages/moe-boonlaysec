<p><em>SJB Day</em>
</p>
<p>The objective of the Brigade is to combine individual efforts for the
public good, by rendering first aid to the sick and wounded on public occasions,
and to develop and promote every means of rendering aid to the sick and
wounded.</p>
<p>In BLS, SJB seeks to equip all cadets with life-saving skills of first
aid, home nursing, occupational safety, health care and emergency assistance,
and at the same time, provide opportunities to help them develop holistically
as a person. Life-saving courses such as CPR-AED and Basic Cardiac Life
Support (BCLS) are organised for the cadets including certification in
Basic First Aid and Basic Home Nursing. Through the Cadet Proficiency Badge
Scheme (CPBS), the cadets achieve different badges upon completion of the
various internal and external courses. The Chief Commissioner’s Badge,
which is the highest award that a cadet can achieve under CPBS, is presented
to cadets who have attained the required number of badges and successfully
completed various assessments.</p>

<p><em>Boon Lay Secondary School SJB Corps</em>
</p>
<p>Our training also includes foot drills which helps to instill discipline
in the students. Aligned to the goals of SJB, our unit provides first aid
services not only to the school, but also to the public by performing public
duties at community events.</p>
<p><strong>Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p>The Boon Lay CC – Safe Hearts Values in Action (VIA) collaboration initiative
started from 2022. Together with NCDCC, we have been serving the community,
doing awareness programmes as well as educating the public in the areas
of CPR and the use of AED. Some of the notable events we have supported
are:</p>

<p><em>Boon Lay CC – Safe Hearts Values in Action (VIA) Collaboration</em>
</p>
<p>These experiences reinforce the importance of learning these life-saving
skills as well as the need for good communication when they engage the
public by educating them about CPR and AED.</p>
