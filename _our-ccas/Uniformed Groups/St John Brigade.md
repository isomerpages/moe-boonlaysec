<p>St John Brigade (SJB) is the uniformed branch of St John Singapore, which
provides first aid and ambulance services, as well as youth development
through its Cadet programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The objective of the Brigade is to combine individual efforts for the
public good, by rendering first aid to the sick and wounded on public occasions,
and to develop and promote every means of rendering aid to the sick and
wounded.</p>
<p>In BLS, SJB seeks to equip all cadets with life-saving skills of first
aid, nursing, occupational safety, health care and emergency assistance,
and at the same time, provide opportunities to help them develop holistically
as a person. Life-saving courses such as CPR-AED and Basic Cardiac Life
Support (BCLS) are organized for the cadets including certification in
Basic First Aid and Basic Home Nursing. Through the Cadet Proficiency Badge
Scheme (CPBS), the cadets achieve different badges upon completion of the
various internal and external courses. The Chief Commissioner’s Badge,
which is the highest award that a cadet can achieve under CPBS, is presented
to cadets who have attained the required number of badges and successfully
completed various assessments.</p>

<h4>Public Service</h4>
<p>The Boon Lay CC – Safe Hearts Values In Action (VIA) collaboration initiative
started from the year 2022. Together with NCDCC, we have been serving the
community, doing awareness programmes as well as educating the public in
the areas of CPR and the use of AED.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the notable events which we had gone through are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CPR AED Awareness during “Hawker and Community Day” at Boon Lay Place
Food Village&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Day Observance Ceremony&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPR AED awareness to Boon Lay residents&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>Boon Lay Edusave award presentation – Sharing CPR AED with the community&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Football Tournament @ Jurong West Stadium</p>

</ol>
<p>These experiences have reinforced within the students the importance of
learning these life-saving skills as well as the need for good communication
when they engage the public by educating them about CPR and AED.</p>
