<p>At BLS, the House System is a key pillar of our student development and
school culture. It is designed to give every student an authentic, meaningful
and joyful learning experience—one that nurtures leadership, strengthens
friendships and builds a strong sense of belonging. Through the House System,
students grow not only as individuals, but as part of a close-knit school
family.</p>
<h2><strong>A Family of Gems</strong></h2>

<p>Anchored in our school’s family-oriented concept, our four Houses are
named after a family of gemstones - Garnet, Emerald, Morganite, Sapphire
(GEMS). Each gemstone symbolises unique strengths and qualities, reminding
students that every individual brings something valuable to the whole.</p>
<p>The four House colours have been carefully selected to reflect both the
school’s heritage and its evolving identity. Together, the names and colours
create a strong visual and emotional connection to each House.</p>
<h2><strong>The House Cup: Recognising the Journey</strong></h2>
<p>The House Cup celebrates effort, growth and collective achievement across
the school year.</p>
<p>Students earn points for their Houses in different domains, such as academics,
CCA involvement, values and participation. At the end of each term, the
House with the highest points in a domain is awarded that domain’s <strong>stone</strong>.</p>

<p>By the end of the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stones collected in each domain are counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The House with the most stones in a domain wins that domain for the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The House that wins the most domains is awarded the <strong>House Cup</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More than just a trophy, the House Cup represents the shared journey of
perseverance, teamwork and commitment shown by every student in the House.</p>
<h2><strong>Growing Together as One Family</strong></h2>
<p>Through the House System, our students learn what it means to belong,
to lead and to care for one another. It transforms school into more than
just a place of learning—it becomes a community where every child feels
valued, supported and proud to be part of something bigger.</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering parents and students as we continue to grow
this vibrant House culture together.</p>
