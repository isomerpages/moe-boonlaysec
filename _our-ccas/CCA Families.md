<p>We aim to provide experiential learning experiences to help develop character
and competencies in every student.</p>
<p>In BLS, we offer Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) which spread across four
domains. These domains are the Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Sports
and Clubs. While some of these CCAs are gender-specific, most are available
for boys and girls to choose from.</p>
