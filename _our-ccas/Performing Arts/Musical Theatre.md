<p>The Boon Lay Secondary School Musical Theatre Club is one of the few schools
in Singapore to focus on Musical Theatre as the main form of theatrical
performance. The musical theatre club combines songs, spoken dialogue and
dance in their performance, with acting as the basis to bring through every
story. Every story is communicated through words, music, movement and the
technical aspects as an integrated whole.</p>
<p>For the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, all the members
in the club took part and performed two different pieces of musical and
were awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. The club has built upon
the experience and managed to successfully achieve a Certificate of Distinction
in the 2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on each other’s strengths and working towards improving as a
team, the club has customised a variety of practice sessions to empower
every member with different performance skills as well as stage management
support.</p>
<p>The club believes in presenting various performance opportunities to ignite
every member’s passion in performing through various school exchanges,
boot camp, internal and public performances. The Boon Lay Secondary School
Musical Theatre Club is certain to groom every passionate performer to
stage their own imagination and become their greater self.</p>
