<p>Boon Lay Secondary School is one of the few schools in Singapore to focus
on Musical Theatre as the main form of theatrical performance. The Boon
Lay Secondary School Musical Theatre Club combines songs, spoken dialogue,
drama and dance in the performances to convey a narrative. Every story
is communicated through words, music, movement and the technical aspects
as an integrated whole.</p>
<p>Building on each other’s strengths and working towards improving as a
team, the club has customised a variety of practice sessions to empower
every member with different performance skills, with stage management support.</p>
<p>The club believes in presenting various performance opportunities to ignite
every member’s passion in performing through various school exchanges,
boot camps, as well as internal and public performances. The club thus
aims to groom every passionate performer in harnessing their sense of imagination
and translating it into performances that enable them to become their greater
self.&nbsp;</p>
