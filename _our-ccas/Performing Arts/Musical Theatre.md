The Boon Lay Secondary School Musical Theatre Club is one of the few schools in Singapore to focus on Musical Theatre as the main form of theatrical performance. The musical theatre club combines songs, spoken dialogue and dance in their performance, with acting as the basis to bring through every story. Every story is communicated through words, music, movement and the technical aspects as an integrated whole.

For the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, all the members in the club took part and performed two different pieces of musical and were awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. The club has built upon the experience and managed to successfully achieve a Certificate of Distinction in the 2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.&nbsp;

Building on each other’s strengths and working towards improving as a team, the club has customised a variety of practice sessions to empower every member with different performance skills as well as stage management support.

The club believes in presenting various performance opportunities to ignite every member’s passion in performing through various school exchanges, boot camp, internal and public performances. The Boon Lay Secondary School Musical Theatre Club is certain to groom every passionate performer to stage their own imagination and become their greater self.
