<p>The Boon Lay Secondary School Choir is a mixed youth choir under the baton
of esteemed conductor, Ms Michelle Poh. The Choir presents the talented
voices of Boon Lay Secondary School at major school events and public showcases.
It performs an extensive repertoire, ranging from Choral Classics to light
jazz pieces, and contemporary pop music. In recent years, the choir has
risen to greater heights, upholding the standard of choral excellence as
the choir continues to achieve the Certificate of Distinction in Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation in four consecutive SYF Arts Presentations
since 2013.</p>
<p>Guided by the Choir’s motto, “the voices of our hearts, the songs of our
lives”, the Boon Lay Secondary School Choir aims to develop a sense of
appreciation for the traditions of choral music, while nurturing and cultivating
a passion for singing in our choristers. Through the various school exchanges,
internal and external choir performances and competitions, the Boon Lay
Secondary School Choir also hopes to inculcate the right values and desirable
social attitudes in all our choristers.</p>
