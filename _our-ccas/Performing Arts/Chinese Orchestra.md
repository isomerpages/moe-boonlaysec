<p>The Boon Lay Secondary School Chinese Orchestra is a vibrant ensemble
comprising five distinct sections: plucked strings, bowed strings, cello
and bass, woodwind, and percussion.</p>
<p>The orchestra recognises the importance of nurturing and showcasing individual
talents. All members have opportunities to demonstrate their abilities
during school performances and external events such as the Chinese New
Year Concert, Aspire and Achieve Day, and Mother Tongue Fiesta.</p>
<p>Beyond instrumental skills, each member learns music theory from our conductor,
instructors, and alumni. Through continuous dedication and hard work over
the years, we have achieved commendable results in the Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentations.</p>
<p>As a musical family, the orchestra instils strong values of responsibility,
resilience, respect, and honour in its members. We have evolved beyond
the traditional perception of performing only classical Chinese music,
embracing a refreshing approach that includes modern pop music, mash-ups,
genre fusion, and classic Chinese pop songs.</p>
