<p>The Boon Lay Secondary School Chinese Orchestra is a vibrant orchestra
that comprises five different sectional categories. They are pluck string,
string, cello bass, wood wind and percussion.</p>
<p>The orchestra understands the importance of honing and highlighting individual
talents. All members are given an opportunity to showcase their talent
during performances in school or at external events like the Chinese New
Year Concert, Aspire and Achieve Day, and Mother Tongue Fiesta.</p>
<p>Each individual in the orchestra also has the opportunity to learn music
theory knowledge from the conductor, instructors and our alumni apart from
just the skills on how to play the various musical instruments. Through
continuous hard work and determination the past few years, we managed to
achieve commendable results in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.</p>
<p>As a family, the orchestra also inculcates a strong sense of responsibility,
resilience, respect and honour in its members. Over the years, we have
also evolved from the usual perception of performing only traditional Chinese
music to a new refreshing approach of showcasing modern pop music, mash-ups,
fusion of different genres of music and classic Chinese pop music.</p>
<p>If you are interested in playing Chinese cultural instruments, come join
us and be part of our family.</p>
