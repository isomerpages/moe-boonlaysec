<p>BLS Contemporary Dance Club prides itself on producing collective magic
on stage from individual strengths. We aspire to inculcate values of discipline
and respect as well as creativity and expressivity on stage and beyond.
Our Contemporary Dance focuses on Hip Hop to align with students' growing
interest in this dynamic genre.</p>
<p>Training involves a progressive journey that takes dancers from beginner
to advanced levels. Beyond movement, the club focuses on character development,
instilling values that foster resilience, teamwork, and leadership. The
club aims to provide many opportunities for its members to discover their
potential, build self-confidence and resilience, as well as develop leadership
and interpersonal skills. In addition, members learn to build and enjoy
a strong camaraderie within and outside the club.</p>
<p>Students have opportunities to showcase their talents in school and outdoor
performances, participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentations,
and attend learning journeys that expose them to diverse dance genres.
This holistic approach develops their technical skills and strengthens
their character as both individuals and team members.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the dance movements and learn modern and contemporary
dance forms, come join us.</p>
