BLS Concert Band nurtures disciplined leaders with excellent musicianship. Our programmes empower students to become independent and forward-looking leaders by providing various opportunities such as sectional leadership, committee roles and participation in our senior-led sectional system.

The band constantly strives to hone and sharpen our musical skills through theoretical and practical assessments. Seeking intra-school and collaborative performance opportunities with our counterparts in other schools throughout the academic year, the band builds members’ confidence and grants them stage exposure. With an enriching and exciting programme, we instill the love of music in all members and empower them to discover the best version of themselves through the art of music.

So if you are interested in music and would love to learn how to play a musical instrument, come join the Concert Band family!

Currently, the instruments that our Band has are Flute, Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Saxophone, Trumpet, French Horn, Trombone, Euphonium, Tuba and other various percussion instruments. More can be allocated depending on cohort size.

2. What kind of band are we and what can my child expect in band?

We are a concert band, which typically performs in a concert setting. We incorporate elements of a marching/military band in our training and regimentation. Occasionally, the band engages in outdoor performances as well (eg. NDP Parade).

3. What leadership opportunities are there?

In the band there is a committee structure that consists of

i. Executive Committee members who manage the band,

ii. Committee members who perform duties to ensure the smooth conduct of the band,

iii. Section Leaders who take charge of the training of their section mates (for students who excel in musicianship).

Every student will be given the opportunity to shine. In BLS Concert Band, we adopt a progression system where students will be trained to manage smaller duties before taking on larger responsibilities.
