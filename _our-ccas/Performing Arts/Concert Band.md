<p>BLS Concert Band nurtures disciplined leaders with excellent musicianship.
Our programmes empower students to become independent and forward-looking
leaders by providing various opportunities such as sectional leadership,
committee roles and participation in our senior-led sectional system.</p>
<p>The band constantly strives to hone and sharpen our musical skills through
theoretical and practical assessments. Seeking intra-school and collaborative
performance opportunities with our counterparts in other schools, the band
builds members’ confidence and grants them stage exposure. With an enriching
and exciting programme, we instill the love of music in all members and
empower them to discover the best version of themselves through the art
of music.</p>
<p>So if you are interested in music and would love to learn how to play
a musical instrument, come join the Concert Band family!</p>

<p><strong>What kind of band is this and what can one expect in band?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are a concert band, which typically performs in a concert setting.
We incorporate elements of a marching/military band in our training and
regimentation. Occasionally, the band engages in outdoor performances as
well (eg. NDP Parade).</p>

<p><strong>What leadership opportunities are there?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the band there is a committee structure that consists of
<br>i. Executive Committee members who manage the band,
<br>ii. Committee members who perform duties to ensure the smooth conduct
of the band,
<br>iii. Section Leaders who take charge of the training of their section
mates (for students who excel in musicianship).</p>
<p>Every student will be given the opportunity to shine. In BLS Concert Band,
we adopt a progression system where students will be trained to manage
smaller duties before taking on larger responsibilities.</p>
