<p>BLS Concert Band nurtures disciplined leaders with excellent musicianship.
Our programmes empower students to become independent and forward-looking
leaders by providing various opportunities such as sectional leadership,
committee roles and participation in our senior-led sectional system.</p>
<p>The band constantly strives to hone and sharpen our musical skills through
theoretical and practical assessments. Seeking intra-school and collaborative
performance opportunities with our counterparts in other schools throughout
the academic year, the band builds members’ confidence and grants them
stage exposure. With an enriching and exciting programme, we instill the
love of music in all members and empower them to discover the best version
of themselves through the art of music.</p>
<p>So if you are interested in music and would love to learn how to play
a musical instrument, come join the Concert Band family!</p>
