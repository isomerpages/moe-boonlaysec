<p>In BLS Malay Dance Club, we strive to ensure each and everyone of our
members are stretched to meet their maximum potential. As a dance family,
we emphasize teamwork and bond amongst our members.</p>

<p>By instilling discipline and resilience in our members, our programmes
are designed to cultivate confidence and commitment in achieving their
goals as performers.. Our dancers have numerous opportunities to perform
and compete in various showcases such as the Esplanade MUARA festival and
the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation or SYF Celebrates. These
experiences help them develop greater self-confidence and mastery of their
dance skills.</p>

<p>In developing our leaders, we also find opportunities to send them for
leadership workshops such as Dance Amplified! for Secondary 3 leaders and
developing their talents through Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity
(SP-CCA) for secondary 1 to 3 students (both organised by MOE CCA Branch).
We also offer attachment programmes to dance companies for industrial experiences.</p>
