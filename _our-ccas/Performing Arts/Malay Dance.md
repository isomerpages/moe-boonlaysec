<p>By instilling discipline and resilience in our members, our programmes
are designed to cultivate confidence and commitment in achieving their
goals as performers.. Our dancers have numerous opportunities to perform
and compete in various showcases such as the Esplanade MUARA festival and
the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation or SYF Celebrates.</p>
<p>These experiences help them develop greater self-confidence and mastery
of their dance skills.</p>

<p>In developing our leaders, we also find opportunities to send them for
leadership workshops such as Dance Amplified! for Secondary 3 leaders and
developing their talents through Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity
(SP-CCA) for Secondary 1 and 2 students, both organised by MOE CCA Branch.
We also offer attachment programmes to dance companies for industrial experiences.</p>
