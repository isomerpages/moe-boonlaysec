<p>In BLS Malay Dance Club, we strive to ensure each and everyone of our
members are stretched to meet their maximum potential.</p>
<p>Inculcating discipline and resilience in our members, our programmes serve
to mould our members to be confident and committed in working towards achieving
their goals. Our dancers are given opportunities to perform and compete
in various showcases such as the Esplanade MUARA festival and the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation or SYF Celebrates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From these events, the dancers acquire important experiences that helped
to develop greater self-confidence and mastery of their dance skills.</p>

<p>The BLS Malay Dance Club has sustained the Certificate of Distinction
in three consecutive SYF Arts Presentations (2019, 2021 and 2023). We also
won 1st Runner Up and Best Floor Pattern&nbsp; for the Gelanggang Tari
2022&nbsp; competition organized by T3aterMuzikalCollective.</p>

<p>In developing our leaders, we also find opportunities to send them for
leadership workshops such as Dance Amplified! for secondary 3 leaders and
developing their talents through Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity
(SP-CCA) for secondary 1 and 2 students, both organised by MOE CCA Branch,
or other possible attachment experience to dance companies.</p>

<p>Lastly, the CCA welcomes both inexperienced and experienced dancers of
all races to join the club so as to promote the spirit of learning from
one another, appreciating and embracing differences, while at the same
time developing one’s competency.</p>
