<p>Welcome to Boon Lay Secondary School (BLS)!</p>
<p>At BLS, we strive to bring out the greatness in every child. This means
developing our students as learners and leaders – who are empathetic and
confident communicators, resilient persons, self-directed lifelong learners
and responsible global citizens. To help us in this mission, we have adopted
a tri-fold approach, namely a <em>family-oriented</em> concept of schooling,
a <em>values-centred</em> education, and an <em>aspiration-focused</em> programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Family-oriented</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At BLS, our students experience our CCA-centric structure, a unique feature
of our school. Students learn and grow with their fellow CCA mates and
teachers throughout their time with us – during CCA time, morning programmes,
common curriculum subjects, Values in Action projects and Character and
Citizenship Education lessons. The time spent together with their CCA mates
and teachers allow for strong junior-senior bonds and strong teacher-student
relationships to be built. Teachers, serving as CCA Mentors (CCAMs), care
for our students and inculcates values, skills and dispositions to help
our students work towards their aspirations. Students, as seniors, would
lead to plan and organise CCA, school and community activities, and guide
their juniors. Students, as juniors, would receive guidance from their
teachers and seniors, as they develop their leadership skills.</p>
<p>We believe and have seen how our CCA-centric structure has fostered a <em>family-oriented</em> culture,
which provides a safe, nurturing and enabling environment for every child
to develop as learners and leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Values-centred</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At BLS, our students experience a values-centred education, where they
would be guided by their teachers and have opportunities to live out the
school values of <em>Wisdom, Excellence, Respect </em>and <em>Honour</em>.
These values provide the foundation for us to equip our students with social-emotional
competencies (managing self, managing relationships and making responsible
decisions) and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (such as critical and
inventive thinking). In addition, we inculcate in our students a growth
mindset and guide them in appreciating the importance of their mindset
in helping them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>We believe that our students, who are anchored by the school and their
personal values, equipped with social-emotional competencies and 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies, and guided by a growth mindset, together with their knowledge
and skills from subjects, would be able to thrive now and in the future.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Aspiration-focused</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At BLS, we design our programmes to be aspiration-focused – this means
that we do our best to provide as many and as diverse learning opportunities
for our students to discover their interests, strengths, and ultimately,
purpose. We infuse Education and Career Guidance (ECG) in many of our programmes,
such as level camps, which complements regular ECG programmes, such as
industry practitioners’ sharing during morning assemblies. We work with
our industry and community partners to provide authentic learning opportunities
for our students, so that our students can learn first-hand about the world
outside of school, in both industries and in the community around them.
This would allow them to explore career and higher education opportunities
in the care, digital and green economies. In addition, we hope that our
students will aspire to serve the community around them.</p>
<p>We believe that our aspiration-focused programme and approach would help
all our students to discover their interests and strengths, articulate
their purpose, and make an informed decision about their life after graduating
from BLS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together with my staff, we look forward to working with you – parents,
alumni, community &amp; industry partners – as close partners, to grow
BLS as a family of learners and leaders, where we bring out the greatness
in every child.</p>
