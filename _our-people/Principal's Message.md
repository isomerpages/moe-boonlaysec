At BLS, we instil in our students the joy of learning (JOL) for life and imbue them with competencies for the 21st&nbsp;century. Our unique tri-fold approach, namely a&nbsp;**family-oriented**&nbsp;concept of schooling; a&nbsp;**CCA-centric**&nbsp;structure and an&nbsp;**aspiration-focused**&nbsp;programme continues to inspire our family of learners and leaders.

At BLS, our teachers take on the nurturing role of a caring Mentor. The teacher inculcates skills, dispositions and values that will put our students in good stead to work toward their aspirations. Students thrive in the school and are provided social, emotional support and aspirational guidance to reach their goals. As a&nbsp;**family**&nbsp;of learners, the BLS staff, work within a collegial environment to grow their craft, explore new ideas and further equip themselves to prepare students to be future-ready.

With our CCA-centric structure, students in BLS build strong bonds, learn and grow together with their fellow CCA mates and teacher mentors throughout their journey in the school. The CCA-centric structure builds strong junior-senior bonds, teacher-student relationships in a family that provides a firm foundation for individual growth. Senior students take on leadership to plan and execute school and community events besides carrying out CCA activities with the support of their CCA teachers as mentors.

The school’s Student Development (SD) Programme inspires JOL as students explore their aspirations. Designed to complement the academic programme, the SD modules extend learning as students discover, experiment and aspire.

Along with my staff, we will continue to inspire our students by providing more opportunities for authentic and inter–disciplinary learning, as they continue to apply their learning from the classroom to the community. We look forward to your partnership as parents, alumni and community partners, as we seek to bring out the greatness in every child to be a responsible and passionate learner and leader.
