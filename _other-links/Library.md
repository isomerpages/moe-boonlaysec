<figcaption>Workshops<br>The brush pen lettering and origami sessions at the library were really enjoyable as they allowed me to unleash my creativity. When doing up the art piece with the brushes, I had to be patient and exercise enough control in order to create a nice piece of work. The facilities at the library, like the stage area and the round tables, also made the learning experience more enjoyable . I enjoyed most the part where we got really creative and made the paper origami cranes which were then used to decorate the library. Our library is not just a quiet place for reading, it is also a fun place to enjoy such activities with schoolmates.</figcaption>
