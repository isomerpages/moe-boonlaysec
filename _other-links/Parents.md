### **Parents**
#### **Purpose of Co-curricular Activities (CCAs)**
The purpose of the CCA programme is to provide students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. It can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, which can help the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. Through the respective CCA programmes, students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCAs also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.
