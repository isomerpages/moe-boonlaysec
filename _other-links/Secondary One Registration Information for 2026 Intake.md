<h4>Welcome to Boon Lay Secondary School (BLS)!</h4>
<p>The Secondary One Registration Exercise marks the beginning of your child’s
/ward’s journey at BLS. We look forward to building a strong partnership
with you to support your child’s development.</p>
<p>At BLS, instead of the typical form class structure, students are grouped
according to their CCA and the CCA family plays the central role in ensuring
holistic development for every child. With this CCA-centric structure,
students gain opportunities to realise their wider purpose and responsibility
in the school and community.</p>
<p><strong>All students who are posted to Boon Lay Secondary School will have to complete the Secondary One Registration Form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/s1bls2026registration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/s1bls2026registration</a>.</strong>
