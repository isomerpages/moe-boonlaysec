## **Release of 2023 GCE O Level Results**

The 2023 GCE O Level Results will be released on 11 January 2024, Thursday.

Students receiving their results are expected to report to the school hall by 1.35pm on the day, in their full school uniform. All students must be properly attired and appropriately groomed in line with the school rules (e.g., no dyed hair, no make-up). Students currently enrolled in ITE may report in their ITE uniform.

*   Students who are unwell and unable to receive their results in person should seek medical attention and **not** return to school to collect their results.
*   Students may collect their results from the school's General Office when they are better, or they may appoint a proxy to collect their results on their behalf.

*   Please inform your CCAM beforehand if a proxy is being nominated for this purpose.
*   The appointed proxy should bring along your physical NRIC/student EZ-Link card in order to collect the physical copy of the results.
