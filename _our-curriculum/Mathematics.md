#### Vision

The Mathematics Department as a key element in BLS’ curriculum in anchoring our students’ growth.

#### Mission

Develop in students a spirit of persistence and an agile mind through the course of BLS’s Mathematics Curriculum to take on the challenges of tomorrow.

#### Classroom Experiences

Learning takes place in the classroom and beyond it. In the preparation of lesson materials, our teachers catered to students’ diverse profile through designing resources based on the Differentiated Instruction (DI) approach. Within the classroom, our teachers facilitate learning by getting students to understand the problems through inquiry and discussion. Our assessment tasks include solving real-world context problems where learners get to develop 21st century competencies such as critical and creative thinking skills. Through the use of Assessment for learning (AfL) strategies in the Mathematics classroom, the learners get to track their own progress and make their adjustments accordingly. There is also extensive use of technology for effective teaching and learning within the classroom and encouraged continued learning outside the classroom.

#### Mathematics comes alive @Mathematics Carnival!

To visualise how Mathematics is present in everyday life, students apply what they have learnt in classrooms to design carnival games as part of their Alternative Assessment. Students made use of mathematical concepts to vary the difficulty levels in their games that they have created, and the student participants try to outwit the game designers to win. In designing the games, the students have shown a high level of creativity and imagination, as well as developed their communication skills to explain the rules and regulations of their games. To make the whole experience as authentic as possible, the school set aside one afternoon for all the S1-S3 NT students to showcase their games at the Mathematics Carnival and invited the rest of the school cohort as well as all staff members to participate and join in the fun.
