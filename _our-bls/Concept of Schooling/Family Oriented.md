### **Family Oriented**
As a school, we are the extended family for each child.&nbsp; Teachers, as elder members of this family are committed to our studentsâ€™ holistic development so that they can fulfil their aspirations and life goals. As a&nbsp;**family-oriented**&nbsp;school, teachers exercise care so that a safe and nurturing environment is provided for each student to explore and nurture his/her passion. Through the learning opportunities in and out of classrooms, students acquire knowledge, practice skills, exercise values, form positive habits and cultivate good attitudes for good character. It prepares them to be future ready so that they can contribute to their family, community and nation.
