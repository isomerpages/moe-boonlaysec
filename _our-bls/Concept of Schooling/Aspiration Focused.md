<h3><strong>Aspiration-Focused</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the academic programme which helps prepare students for
the future, an expansive range of aspiration focused programmes and student
developments modules is also available to cater to the varied aspirations
of our students. These programmes and modules, which range from entry to
advanced levels, are designed to help our students explore and discover
their interests. The programmes and modules allow students to foster a
lifelong love of learning, and it is this passion that drives them to work
towards fulfilling their dreams and aspirations.</p>

needs of our students over their 4-5 years in school. With the diverse,
rich and meaningful experiences offered, our students will, explore and
discover their passion, deepen their skills and build a portfolio of experiences
as part of their journey to achieving their dreams and aspirations.</p>
