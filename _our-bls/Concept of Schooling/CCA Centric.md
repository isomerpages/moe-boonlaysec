### **CCA-Centric**
At BLS, in place of the typical form class structure, the CCA family plays the central role in ensuring a holistic development for every child. CCAs provide the organic structure for students to cultivate good character and values through interaction with their CCA peers, CCA teachers and other CCA families. Through CCAs, students get opportunities to realise their wider purpose and responsibility in the school and community.

With this CCA-centric structure, students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to the school is further deepened with CCA leaders, school seniors and alumni being mentors to younger students. CCA teachers also play a significant role in every child’s life as every one of them is committed to bringing out the greatness in every student.
