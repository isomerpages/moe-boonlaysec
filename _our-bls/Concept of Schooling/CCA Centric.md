<h3><strong>CCA-Centric</strong></h3>
<p>At BLS, in place of the typical form class structure, the CCA family plays
the central role in ensuring a holistic development for every child. CCAs
provide the organic structure for students to cultivate good character
and values through interaction with their CCA peers, CCA teachers and other
CCA families. Through CCAs, students get opportunities to realise their
wider purpose and responsibility in the school and community.</p>
<p>With this CCA-centric structure, students’ sense of belonging, commitment
and sense of responsibility to the school is further deepened with CCA
leaders, school seniors and alumni being mentors to younger students. CCA
teachers also play a significant role in every child’s life as every one
of them is committed to bringing out the greatness in every student.</p>
