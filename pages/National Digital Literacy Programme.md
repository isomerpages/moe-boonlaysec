### **National Digital Literacy Programme**
At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.

#### **Connect, Curate, Create**
At Boon Lay Secondary School, our teachers design varied learning experiences for our students to learn new media literacies where they connect, curate and create. Through a variety of lessons from self paced modular academic curriculum modules to authentic multidisciplinary lessons, our students are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate the increasingly digital VUCA world.
