At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.

#### **Connect, Curate, Create**
At Boon Lay Secondary School, our teachers design varied learning experiences for our students to learn new media literacies where they connect, curate and create. Through a variety of lessons from self paced modular academic curriculum modules to authentic multidisciplinary lessons, our students are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate the increasingly digital VUCA world.

#### **Personal Learning Device**
The school will be using the **iPad** **10.2”** for teaching and learning for the Year 2023. The device bundle consists of:

*   Apple iPad 10.2” 64GB Wi-Fi (9th Generation)
*   Stylus: Apple Pencil (1st Generation)
*   Protective Casing and Keyboard: Logitech Ruggedized Combo 3
*   3-year Insurance and 3-year Warranty

#### **Financial Assistance**
Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please apply for financial assistance by **18 January 2023 (Wednesday)**.

Students who do not wish to purchase because they already have their own iPads will have to check with the school to ascertain whether the specifications of their existing devices meet the schools’ requirements. These existing devices must also be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) software to manage the student’s access and usage. Please email us at [blss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:blss@moe.edu.sg)

#### Device Management Application**

Please note that **the PLD will be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA)**. The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA has 3 main components:

*   Classroom Management Service.
*   Mobile Device Management Service.
*   Usage Management Service.
