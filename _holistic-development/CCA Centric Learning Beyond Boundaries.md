2\.  **Active Contributor** who is able to determine and effectively assume the role he/she will play in a group, and work in a respectful manner with others in a group setting to meet the group’s goals;<br>
3\.  **Confident Person** who is able to demonstrate appropriate skills and behavior to work together with people from a diverse range of backgrounds within and beyond Singapore;<br>
4\.  **Concerned Citizen** who demonstrates awareness of Singapore’s role in addressing issues in the global community.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the CCLBB programme has taken on a virtual approach, connecting BoonLayians with their peers in overseas partner schools through meaningful online projects and interaction sessions.
