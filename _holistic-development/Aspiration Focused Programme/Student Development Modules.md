---
The Student Development (SD) module programme is designed to provide a platform for, and to aid students in discovering their dreams and aspirations using an i.D.E.A. (i Discover, Explore, Aspire) approach. Through a Whole-School Approach, modular learning experiences were designed and conducted to broaden and deepen students’ exposure and competencies required in various post-secondary courses/careers.

In BLS, the various SD modules are categorized into different domains under the DREAMS domains. This draws alignment with our school’s focus in aspiration-building, and establishes links with the broad post-sec educational/career pathways. With active involvement of stakeholders, students are also able to learn work and life values and appreciate the diverse pathways available for them.

The SD module programme has been awarded MOE INNERGY Award  in 2018.
