### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) develops student interest in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and helps students connect and apply academic knowledge and skills in authentic settings based on the theme Sustainability.

#### **Programme Outcomes**
Having a basic knowledge of STEAM will open up options for students to pursue courses and careers that are related to science, engineering, technology and design. Hence, the ALP is developed with the following objectives:

*   To imbue in students a scientific mind-set and to equip them with foundational experimental skills
*   To expose students to different areas of science and technology through hands-on activities
*   To allow students to gain an understanding and appreciation of the scientific advancement in the area of STEAM

#### **Programme and Key Activities**
The ALP in BLS is organised in two tiers. The Tier 1 programme is a 20-hour programme comprising a set of common modules for all Secondary 1 and 2 students. Through these modules, students acquire basic coding knowledge and develop STE(A)M-related skills, communication and collaborative skills, critical thinking and creativity. These modules are delivered by the ALP teachers during the weekly ALP lessons over the course of one Semester, within curriculum time.
