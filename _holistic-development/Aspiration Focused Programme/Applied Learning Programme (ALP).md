### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) develops student interest in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and helps students connect and apply academic knowledge and skills in authentic settings based on the theme Sustainability.

#### **Programme Outcomes**
Having a basic knowledge of STEAM will open up options for students to pursue courses and careers that are related to science, engineering, technology and design. Hence, the ALP is developed with the following objectives:

*   To imbue in students a scientific mind-set and to equip them with foundational experimental skills
*   To expose students to different areas of science and technology through hands-on activities
*   To allow students to gain an understanding and appreciation of the scientific advancement in the area of STEAM

#### **Programme and Key Activities**
The ALP in BLS is organised in two tiers. The Tier 1 programme is a 20-hour programme comprising a set of common modules for all Secondary 1 and 2 students. Through these modules, students acquire basic coding knowledge and develop STE(A)M-related skills, communication and collaborative skills, critical thinking and creativity. These modules are delivered by the ALP teachers during the weekly ALP lessons over the course of one Semester, within curriculum time.

Selected Secondary 2 and 3 students interested in pursuing their interest and developing their STE(A)M-related skills are identified for the Tier 2 programme, where they have opportunities to deepen and broaden their knowledge in the field and are challenged to apply their knowledge in projects and competitions. Students will also be invited for industry visits and have opportunities to interact with professionals in the field.

Our ALP curriculum is guided by our 3’A’ Framework – **A**cquisition, **A**ppreciation and **A**pplication. Using an inquiry-based approach, students **_acquire_** (i) knowledge on a diverse range of materials through hands-on activities, group discussions, online research, as well as the (ii) problem solving and experimental skills required for them to carry out sound scientific investigations.  Through mini-research projects, students are kept abreast with the developments in the field of Materials Science, and at the same time develop an **_appreciation_** for the innovative use of materials in everyday life.  Design challenges provide students with the opportunity to **_apply_** their knowledge and skills to improve on existing products or to invent new ones.
