#### **Vision**
Every student a **C**onfident youth, **C**oncerned citizen and an **E**mpathetic leader.

#### **Mission**
CCE in BLS seeks to provide an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way. We seek to equip every student with knowledge, skills and values to develop them into confident leaders of empathy, who are guided by sound values, principles and actively contribute to the school, community and nation.

#### **Structure**
BLS has redesigned CCE to be based on CCAs & CCA-cluster by level. The spiral CCE curriculum is conducted by CCAMs in a CCA-Centric Model. With this approach, students get to hear more perspectives during cross-stream (CCA Cluster by levels) or cross-stream, cross-level (by CCAs) discussions.
