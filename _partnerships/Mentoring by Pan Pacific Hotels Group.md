<p>Since 2022, our school has worked closely with UOL-Pan Pacific Hotels
Group (PPHG) to offer the Fulfilling Life through Experiences (FLEX) Mentoring
Programme. This initiative empowers students by providing them with mentorship
and real-world externship opportunities. Through consistent guidance from
corporate mentors, students benefit from their expertise. This collaboration
not only equips our students with the knowledge and skills to make informed
decisions, but also exposes them to how industries are leading in the digital
age.</p>
