<p>Contributing to the community gives our students a greater sense of purpose,
strengthens their confidence, and helps them to see themselves as active
contributors and champions of change. One example is Project Joy, an annual
hamper making and distribution activity to families in need during the
Chinese New Year period, in collaboration with our school’s long-time partners,
Boon Lay and Nanyang Constituencies. Another would be the Uniformed Groups’
hands-on sharing sessions on basic CPR/AED with the same constituencies
(Safe Hearts Programme).</p>

<p>Together with Westwood Secondary and Methodist Girls’ School, our school
has worked closely with ActiveSg Unleash the Roar (UTR) to form a cluster-based
football academy for girls. Girls across the three schools train regularly
at BLS and participate in friendlies and the NSGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme provides a platform for female students across the three
schools to train regularly at BLS, engage in friendly matches, and participate
in the National School Games (NSGs). The initiative not only nurtures emerging
female football talent but also fosters social integration by bringing
together girls from diverse backgrounds.</p>
