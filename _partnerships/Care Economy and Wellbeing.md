<p><strong><u>School Football Academy (SFA) for girls with Unleash the Roar (UTR)</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Together with Westwood Secondary and Methodist Girlsâ€™ School, our school
has worked closely with ActiveSg Unleash the Roar (UTR) to form a cluster-based
football academy for girls. Girls across the three schools train regularly
at BLS and participate in friendlies and the NSGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme provides a platform for female students across the three
schools to train regularly at BLS, engage in friendly matches, and participate
in the National School Games (NSGs). The initiative not only nurtures emerging
female football talent but also fosters social integration by bringing
together girls from diverse backgrounds.</p>
