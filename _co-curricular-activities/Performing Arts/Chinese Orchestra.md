The Boon Lay Secondary School Chinese Orchestra is a vibrant orchestra that comprises of five different sectional categories. They are pluck string, string, cello bass, wood wind and percussion.

Boon Lay Secondary School Chinese Orchestra understands the importance of honing and highlighting individual talents. Every member is thus given an opportunity to showcase their talent during performances in school or at external events like the Chinese New Year Concert, Aspire and Achieve Day, and Mother Tongue Fiesta.

Each individual in the orchestra also has the opportunity to learn music theory knowledge from the conductor, instructors and our alumni apart from just the skills on how to play the various musical instruments. Through continuous hard work and determination the past few years, we managed to achieve the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2019 and 2021.

As a family, Chinese Orchestra also inculcates a strong sense of responsibility, resilience, respect and honour in its members. As a result of this, we obtained second place for the Boon Lay Secondary School SHINE Award in 2018, and a fourth placing in 2019. Over the years, we have also evolved from the usual perception of performing only traditional Chinese music to a new refreshing approach of showcasing modern pop music, mash-ups, fusion of different genres of music and classic Chinese pop music.

If you are interested in playing Chinese cultural instruments, come join us and be part of our family.
