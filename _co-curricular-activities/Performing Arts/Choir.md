The Boon Lay Secondary School Choir is a mixed youth choir. The Choir presents the talented voices of Boon Lay Secondary School at major school events and public showcases. It performs an extensive repertoire, ranging from Choral Classics to light jazz pieces, and contemporary pop music. In recent years, the choir has risen to greater heights, upholding the standard of choral excellence as the choir continues to achieve the Certificate of Distinction in Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation since 2013.

Guided by the Choir’s motto, “the voices of our hearts, the songs of our lives”, the Boon Lay Secondary School Choir aims to develop a sense of appreciation for the traditions of choral music, while nurturing and cultivating a passion for singing in our members. Through the various school exchanges, internal and external choir performances and competitions, the Boon Lay Secondary School Choir also hopes to inculcate the right values and desirable social attitudes in all our members.
