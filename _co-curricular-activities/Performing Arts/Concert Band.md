BLS Concert Band nurtures disciplined leaders with excellent musicianship. Our programmes empower students to become independent and forward-looking leaders through providing various opportunities such as sectional leadership, committee roles and participation in our junior-senior buddy system.

The band constantly strives to hone and sharpen our musical skills through theoretical and practical assessments. Seeking intra-school and collaborative performance opportunities with our counterparts in other schools throughout the academic year, the band builds members’ confidence and grants them stage exposure. With an enriching and exciting programme, we instill the love of music in all members and empower them to discover the best version of themselves through the art of music.

So if you are interested in music and would love to learn how to play a musical instrument, come join the Concert Band family!
