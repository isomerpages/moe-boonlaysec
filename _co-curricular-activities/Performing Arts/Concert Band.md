### **Concert Band**
BLS Concert Band nurtures disciplined leaders with excellent musicianship. Our programmes empower students to become independent and forward-looking leaders through providing various opportunities such as sectional leadership, committee roles and participation in our junior-senior buddy system.

Under the baton of our conductor Mr Eddie Chng, the band constantly strives to hone and sharpen our musical skills through theoretical and practical assessments. Seeking intra-school and collaborative performance opportunities with our counterparts in other schools throughout the academic year, the band builds members’ confidence and grants them stage exposure. With an enriching and exciting programme, we instill the love of music in all members and empower them to discover the best version of themselves through the art of music.

So if you are interested in music and would love to learn how to play a musical instrument, come join the Concert Band family!

**2\. What kind of band are we and what can my child expect in band?**<br>
Answer:<br>
We are a _concert band_, which typically perform in a concert setting. We incorporate elements of a _marching/military_ _band_ in our training and regimentation. Occasionally, the band engages in outdoor performances as well (eg. NDP Parade).

**3\. What leadership opportunities are there?**<br>
Answer:<br>
In the band there is a committee structure that consists of<br>
i. _Executive Committee members_ who manage the band,<br>
ii. _Committee members_ who perform duties to ensure the smooth conduct of the band,<br>
iii. _Section Leaders_ who take charge of the training of their section mates (for students who excel in musicianship).<br>
Every student will be given the opportunity to shine. In BLS Concert Band, we adopt a progression system where students will be trained to manage smaller duties before taking on larger responsibilities.

**4\. Is it safe to play in the band given the COVID-19 situation?**<br>
Answer:<br>
BLS Concert Band follows the MOE ordained Safe Management Measures (SMM) Guidelines in the conduct of our practice sessions. During physical practices, students will be seated / standing ≥ 1m apart (masked) and ≥ 2m apart (unmasked) in a well-ventilated venue where only student wind players can be unmasked, with the mandatory presence of 1 teacher/instructor. Additionally, in situations of heightened alert and face-to-face practices cannot be held, students would bring home their instruments and their music learning journey would continue at home with the help of specialized tutors who oversee their training through Zoom sessions.
