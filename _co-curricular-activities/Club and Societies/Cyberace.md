### **Cyberace**
CyberAce is an Infocomm and Technology (IT) club focusing on the areas of the robotics, media and photography. In these areas, the club helps its members to be good at the related skills and further develops them, at the same time sharpening their logical and creative thinking abilities.

Through the various contributions via the club activities and school events, members develop a great sense of responsibility and discipline in their respective teams. The Photography Team captures important moments during school events while the Design Team uses applications such as Inkscape to produce publicity materials for the schoolâ€™s social media pages. Using the Lego Mindstorm EV3, the Robotics Team gets to stretch their ability in the area of coding. Also, the club actively seeks opportunities for its members to challenge themselves in external competitions such as the Lego Mindstorm, Digital Storytelling and many others. Concurrently, by participating in the competitions and representing the school at the same time, it helps them in their LEAPS 2.0 achievements.

Leadership is another area where we place an importance to. The executive members of the Cyberace Club are given platforms to hone their planning and leadership skills by running the club under the guidance of the teachers-in-charge. Events that the executive members have organised include Bonding Day and the Values In Action activities. Now, they assist in the planning and running of e-CCAs.

Lastly, CyberAce Club builds in its members confidence, creativity and independence, while having fun and building relationships at the same time.

So come and join us and explore the world of digital technology.
