CyberAce's principal aim is to enhance students' proficiency in design, programming, and photography by integrating these disciplines into projects that capitalise on their intersections. The club seeks to cultivate logical and creative thinking skills among its members, providing them with hands-on experience in various activities and events. This includes capturing important moments at school events, crafting publicity materials, and participating in robotics competitions, all contributing to the development of valuable skills.

Furthermore, the club actively pursues opportunities for members to push their boundaries in external competitions such as First Lego League, IgNite Challenge and Digital Storytelling, thereby contributing to their LEAPS 2.0 achievements. Emphasising leadership development, executive members take charge of organising events like Bonding Day and Values In Action activities and now play integral roles in planning and executing CCAs.

In essence, CyberAce Club adopts a comprehensive approach to nurture confidence, creativity and independence in its members, fostering a dynamic environment for building relationships. Join us on an exploration of the captivating realm of digital technology!
