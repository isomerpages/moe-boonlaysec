### **Clubs and Societies**
Our Clubs CCAs open up numerous doors leading to endless possibilities in the area of robotics, multimedia, sound engineering and photography.

In Audio Visual Aid club, you will learn skills related to sound engineering, providing crucial support during the schoolâ€™s major events as well as the daily requirements like morning assembly.

Our Cyberace club trains its members to be proficient in the areas of multimedia, photography and robotics. They too lend crucial support during school events, working side-by-side with the Audio Visual Aid club to ensure the smooth experience of those events as well as capture those precious moments, to be kept in the school archives and used for future purposes.

These two clubs continue to improve themselves, always finding external opportunities such as competitions and workshops to ensure that its members can apply what they have learned in their CCAs onto the real world.

If you have what it takes to be part of these families, make the choice to join them.
