### **Uniformed Groups**
Our Uniformed Groups CCAs have always performed well and strives to be better every year. Notwithstanding their excellent achievements in the Best Unit assessments, our uniformed units have also put in place activities that will focus on developing quality leaders in their respective fields.

Our UGs comprise of:

1\.  [Boysâ€™ Brigade 82nd Company (Boys)](https://staging.d264sf5mc1ffsk.amplifyapp.com/holistic-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/boys-brigade/)<br>
2\. [National Cadet Corps (Land) (Boys)](https://staging.d264sf5mc1ffsk.amplifyapp.com/holistic-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/ncc/)<br>
3\. [National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (Boys & Girls)](https://staging.d264sf5mc1ffsk.amplifyapp.com/holistic-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/ncdcc/)<br>
4\. [National Police Cadet Corps (Boys & Girls)](https://staging.d264sf5mc1ffsk.amplifyapp.com/holistic-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/npcc/)<br>
5\. [St John Brigade (Boys & Girls)](https://staging.d264sf5mc1ffsk.amplifyapp.com/holistic-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/st-john-brigade/)

The UGs are made up of a group of very disciplined cadets and dedicated CCA Mentors who believe in espousing the school value of Excellence. Their hard work during their training sessions are all geared to achieve greatness and a high level of self-competency. It definitely shows in their achievements, year after year.

In 2020, all but one received the Gold and Distinction Awards for their yearly unit assessments exercise, with that one CCA receiving a Silver Award, which is a sustained effort from the previous year.

If you have the spirit and resolve to excel in the UG CCAs, make them the top choices in your selection exercise.
