### **St John Brigade**
St John Brigade (SJB) is the uniformed branch of St John Singapore, which provides first aid and ambulance services, as well as youth development through its Cadet programme.

The objective of the Brigade is to combine individual efforts for the public good, by rendering first aid to the sick and wounded on public occasions, and to develop and promote every means of rendering aid to the sick and wounded.

In BLS, SJB seeks to equip all cadets with life-saving skills of first aid, nursing, occupational safety, health care and emergency assistance, and at the same time, provide opportunities to help them develop holistically as a person. Life-saving courses such as CPR-AED and Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) are organised for the cadets including certification in Basic First Aid and Basic Home Nursing. Through the Cadet Proficiency Badge Scheme (CPBS), the cadets achieve different badges upon completion of the various internal and external courses. The Chief Comissioner’s Badge, which is the highest award that a cadet can achieve under CPBS, is presented to cadets who have attained the required number of badges. Our training also include foot drills which helps to instill discipline in the students.

Aligned to the goals of SJB, our unit provides first aid services not only to the school, but also to the public by performing public duties at community events.

Come join us and be trained to save lives.
