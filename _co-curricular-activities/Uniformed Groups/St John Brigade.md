St John Brigade (SJB) is the uniformed branch of St John Singapore, which provides first aid and ambulance services, as well as youth development through its Cadet programme.

The objective of the Brigade is to combine individual efforts for the public good, by rendering first aid to the sick and wounded on public occasions, and to develop and promote every means of rendering aid to the sick and wounded.

In BLS, SJB seeks to equip all cadets with life-saving skills of first aid, nursing, occupational safety, health care and emergency assistance, and at the same time, provide opportunities to help them develop holistically as a person. Life-saving courses such as CPR-AED and Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) are organized for the cadets including certification in Basic First Aid and Basic Home Nursing. Through the Cadet Proficiency Badge Scheme (CPBS), the cadets achieve different badges upon completion of the various internal and external courses. The Chief Commissioner’s Badge, which is the highest award that a cadet can achieve under CPBS, is presented to cadets who have attained the required number of badges and successfully completed various assessments.

#### Public Service
The Boon Lay CC – Safe Hearts Values In Action (VIA) collaboration initiative started from the year 2022. Together with NCDCC, we have been serving the community, doing awareness programmes as well as educating the public in the areas of CPR and the use of AED.&nbsp;

Some of the notable events which we had gone through are:

1.  CPR AED Awareness during “Hawker and Community Day” at Boon Lay Place Food Village&nbsp;
    
2.  National Day Observance Ceremony&nbsp;
    
3.  CPR AED awareness to Boon Lay residents&nbsp;
    
4.  Boon Lay Edusave award presentation – Sharing CPR AED with the community&nbsp;
    
5.  Football Tournament @ Jurong West Stadium
    
These experiences have reinforced within the students the importance of learning these life-saving skills as well as the need for good communication when they engage the public by educating them about CPR and AED.
