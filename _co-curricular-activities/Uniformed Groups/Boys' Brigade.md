The vision of the Boys’ Brigade (BB) is to be the youth organisation of choice, with the aim to nurture youth, based on Christian values to serve and lead.

Our Boys’ Brigade, the 82nd Company, serves the community through events such as BB CARES (Community Activities Rallying Everyone to Serve) and BB Share-a-Gift, spreading joy to the less fortunate. To show our support and to raise awareness of inclusivity, we participated in the Purple Parade. The 82nd company also participates in many events and competitions every year, including the BB Blaze and Character Quest, which are island-wide competitions where schools across Singapore compete against one another.

The company instills discipline and teamwork through activities such as the annual expedition and kayaking. It’s comprehensive programme of life skills such as first aid, community service, drills and campcraft, moulds them to be well-rounded individuals. It’s robust training programme and achievements saw it garnering the J M Fraser Award for Company Excellence (Silver) in 2020. This is the second year running that we have achieved this award, an improvement from the years preceding them.

The 82nd Boys’ Brigade Company seeks to grow from strength to strength, and nurture new and current members into better boys by instilling the values of obedience, discipline and self-respect into them, so as to better prepare them for challenges that may come their way in the future.
