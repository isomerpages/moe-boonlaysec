With the mission of developing its members to be active citizens and community leaders, National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) serves as a platform to harness and mould the leadership competencies of its members. This is achieved through a wide spectrum of activities that transpire values that are necessary for today’s society such as teamwork, creative thinking and conflict resolution.

Whilst training may be rigorous at times, it is through these tough times that our members’ character and values are formed, specifically during the drills and camp craft sessions that continue to play an integral role in the NPCC identity.

#### **Self-directed Learner**
The pinnacle of **excellence** starts with inculcating the correct values in our members. Our members take ownership of their learning, picking up technical skills and acquiring knowledge critical for their growth in NPCC.

#### **Confident Person**
Our members develop social skills via their exposure to various student enrichment programmes such as air pistol course, basic sport climbing and kayaking exposure. These varied experiences promote team spirit, communication and **respect**. These values mould our members to be valiant and confident individuals.

#### **Concerned Citizen**
Our members care about the school and the community. They impact the school by organising the annual Community Safety & Security Programme as well as the community by raising awareness on crime prevention in public spaces in the Police Youth Ambassador Programme. Our members work in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to keep Singapore safe.

#### **Active Contributor**
Engaging the head, heart and hands of our members, they gain **wisdom** and strive to bring **honour** to NPCC. They develop into visionary leaders which are forward thinking by beginning with the end in mind. With this mindset, our members are encouraged to be attuned with the needs of the community and seek proactive steps to ameliorate the issues identified.
