Aligned to the motto of the National School Games (NSG), Boon Lay Secondary School Badminton team believes in character in sporting excellence, in recognition of the important role sports participation and competitions play in the character development of our students, even as they pursue sporting excellence.

The team’s motto is “Smashing Limits”, which means building on our previous successes over the years. With that in mind, we strive to continue to bring more glory to the school in the years to come. The achievements have been brought about by the dedication, commitment and tremendous support from the players, teachers-in-charge and the various stakeholders.

In 2020, the ‘B’ Division boys were en route to the second round but it was put to a halt by the Covid-19 situation. Nevertheless, the team remains resilient at all times, especially in times of uncertainty. The team engaged in meaningful activities during the Circuit Breaker period, such as partnering with Fei Yue Community Services to educate senior citizens on some age-appropriate stretches via videography. The team was also involved in the “Stronger Together” Challenge, which was a school initiative to encourage students to keep fit and healthy while at home.

In 2022, we opened up a ‘C’ Division girls team. Even though we are still in our first year, the girls are very motivated and determined to do their best. The girls displayed their discipline and enthusiasm through their punctuality and eagerness to acquire new skills and knowledge. The girls had shown vast improvements from when they first joined, to now, displaying potential in their individual talents.

So do join us and contribute to this family of smashing people!
