Aligned to the motto of the National School Games (NSG), Boon Lay Secondary School Badminton team believes in character in sporting excellence, in recognition of the important role sports participation and competitions play in the character development of our students, even as they pursue sporting excellence.

The team’s motto is “Smashing Limits”, which means building on our previous successes over the years. With that in mind, we strive to continue to bring more glory to the school in the years to come. The achievements have been brought about by the dedication, commitment and tremendous support from the players, teachers-in-charge and the various stakeholders.

In 2023., the ‘B’ Division and ‘C’ Division boys took part in the West Zone National Schools Games (NSG) and fought hard in the competition for the school. The team has shown resilience and confidence at all times, especially&nbsp; during difficult games. The team also engaged in meaningful VIA activities in Semester 1 using Design Thinking to improve awareness in the school with regards to maintaining our school facilities.

In 2023, we also have the ‘C’ Division girls team taking&nbsp; part in the NSG for the very first time. Our girls are very motivated and played well in the competition.. They displayed their discipline and enthusiasm through their punctuality and eagerness to acquire new skills and knowledge. The girls had shown vast improvements from when they first joined, displaying potential in their individual talents.

So do join us and contribute to this family of smashing people!
