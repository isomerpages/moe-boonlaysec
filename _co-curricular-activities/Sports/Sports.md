### **Sports**
The Sports CCAs in BLS provides the platforms for students to develop the values of resilience, diligence and sportsmanship. Through training and competing in the various competitions, whether in the National School Games or other sanctioned tournaments, students amass invaluable experiences which will serve them well for their future.

Though winning is the ultimate aim, it is not the only aim. Our CCA Mentors and dedicated coaches will engage you to realise your potential in the sport and develop your skills accordingly so that you will be competitive enough to face the challenges in the respective competitions.

Sports unite people. If you are interested in taking up the sporting challenge for the duration of your stay in BLS, make them your top few choices.
