### **Basketball**
Boon Lay Secondary School Basketball team aims to develop the basketball players to be leaders and team players on and off the court. In its student development programme, beyond developing the students in basketball skills and game strategies, the team also places importance on leadership development, building team work, perseverance and dedication.

The team believes in the joy of sports pursuit, basketball. The basketball training sessions and competitions may be demanding, but these sessions, and together with the other team activities and events, create positive and lasting sporting experiences for the boys.

Annually, the team participates in the National School Games (NSG) West Zone Basketball championships.

The team is also active in the Values in Action (VIA) education. One of its recent VIA project was to learn more about energy efficiency in Singapore, and raise awareness about energy conservation and climate change. The message was shared with the school during one of the morning assemblies. We also interacted with the residents in the community, through door-to-door sharings, and the distribution of posters and souvenirs with energy conservation messages attached to them.

Due to Covid-19, 2021 was a difficult year for many. However, it was also during this period that the team further demonstrated its perseverance, dedication and determination to excel in the sport. During the e-CCA training sessions, the boys practiced their basketball drills and footwork, built up their stamina through physical trainings, all from the comfort and safety of their homes.

As we move forward to 2022, Team BLS basketball is looking forward to another memorable and exciting year.
