BLS Team Netball is a CCA which promotes great teamwork and dedication. Our training sessions take place on Tuesdays and Fridays. During these training sessions, the team explores various training methods, including strengthening techniques to ensure that we are equipped with the necessary Netball skills, stamina as well as endurance in preparation for our upcoming matches and competitions. Off court, the team ensures they remain physically active and set targets to meet the internal school sports events such as Games Day and the BLS SHINE Award.

Both our B and C Division teams participate in the National Schools Games (NSG) West Zone Netball Inter-School Competition, M1 Schools Challenge League as well as Deloitte Pesta Sukan Tournament annually. In the M1 Schools Challenge League, our team has been winning medals in the group categories for the past three years. During these competitions, the Netball team players showed strong perseverance and resilience throughout.

Besides the competitions, the team organises friendly matches with other schools (prior to COVID-19). Through these competitions and friendly games, our players are able to build strong camaraderie amongst themselves while at the same time pit their talents against other teams.

BLS Team Netball will continue to adapt, evolve, persevere and strive for greater heights to ensure that each player achieves her best version.
