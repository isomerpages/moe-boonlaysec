### **History**

BLS draws on the proud heritage of Boon Lay Secondary School and Pioneer Secondary School. Collectively it represents almost 70 years of heritage and tradition. Since the two schools merged in 2017, we have built on the strengths and heritage of our past and have begun to forge ahead with a new vision to empower our students to realise their dreams.

#### **Heritage Garden & Gallery**
The BLS Heritage Garden was created to preserve the histories of the  school as Boon Lay Secondary and Pioneer Secondary School merged as one in 2017.

The BLS Heritage Garden is located at the front of the school immediately upon entry through the main gate with the Gallery at the front of the General Office.  It comprises 2 school icons representing the merger.  The gallery captures the past of the merger and projects the present into the future with a clear articulation of the new Vision, Mission and Values and Motto of BLS.

#### **Unity Sculpture**
The sculpture “UNITY” was officially opened by Mr Ho Kah Leong, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Environment) and MP for Jurong on 20 January 1995. The abstract aluminum structure was designed by our renowned Singapore sculptor, Mr Ng Eng Teng. “UNITY” stands 180cm tall. It shows two abstract head profiles united as one and together opens a progressing path to success. It is a see-through design with interesting views from all sides. The ladder-like design represents success in the pursuit of learning wisdom and the ideals of the school. The new school logo is designed after the “UNITY” sculpture.

#### **Wisdom Bridge**
In 1978, Mr Foo Yong Yang, an art teacher, envisioned constructing a bridge over a pond with a hillock. Students worked enthusiastically and tirelessly on the bridge. The hillock was eventually named “Wen Tai” (Scholar’s Hill) and the pond “Li Chi” (Propriety Pond), forming the words “Wen Li” (Boon Lay). Naming the bridge, “Hui Qiao” (Wisdom Bridge) was also very meaningful as it symbolised the wisdom that the school hoped each student would develop at the end of their journey. A replica of the “Wisdom Bridge” has been constructed in the current school compound.

Taken together, the school icons are visible reminders to our current students that they have inherited almost 70 years of heritage, tradition, achievements and expectations.  Our students are constantly reminded that great things can only be accomplished when they are united in purpose and will. Furthermore, they are constantly reminded that their primary purpose in school is the pursuit of wisdom (not just academic grades), so that they will be able to lead meaningful lives.

While looking forward to a new vision and mission that stretches us to explore innovative ways of developing our students and infusing in them the joy of learning, we are still anchored to our roots. As we combined the best of both schools to create a new beginning, we want to remember our roots and the heritage gallery showcases our separate journeys that have led us to be one.
