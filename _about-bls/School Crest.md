The school logo shows the profiles of two people united as one moving on an upward path towards their aspirations. Launched in November 2016, it marks the merger of Pioneer Secondary and Boon Lay Secondary. The school logo symbolically represents the teacher and student walking hand in hand as part of an extended family working together.

The ladder-like design represents success in pursuit of learning wisdom and the ideals of the school. It is a clarion call for endeavouring and aspiring towards greater heights while honouring and treasuring our heritage. BLS is the acronym for Boon Lay Secondary. The Chinese name of the school accompany the school crest, reflects the Chinese heritage of Boon Lay Secondary when it began in 1977 as a bilingual school offering both Chinese and English as a medium of instruction.
