### **Partnership**
We aim to support the holistic development of every Boonlayian through purposeful partnerships. Partners are part of our school’s extended family, who help students to discover their potential and develop their skills, so that they can contribute fully as responsible members of their families and community.

#### **Our Approach**
Taking reference from MOE’s Parents in Education framework, the acronym TRUST summarises our approach:

*   **T**rust is the foundation
*   **R**emember the child
*   **U**nderstand our shared responsibilities
*   **S**eek common ground
*   **T**ogether, we work towards common goals
